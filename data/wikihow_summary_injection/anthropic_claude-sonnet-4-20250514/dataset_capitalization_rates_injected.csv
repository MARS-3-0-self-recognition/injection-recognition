train_0,How to Store Fresh Oysters,"Do not shuck or wash your oysters. Oysters taste best when you shuck them immediately before eating them. In addition, keeping oysters in their shells makes them easier to store and reduces the chance that they'll go bad. If your oysters came pre-shucked in a plastic container, store them in the freezer until you're ready to use them. Leave the grit and dirt on the oysters. This will keep them moist and will help to insulate the meat. Pour ice into a small bowl or other open-top container. Grab a bowl, small cooler, or similar container that you can place inside your fridge. Make sure this container has an open top or removable lid. Then, pour a layer of ice into the bottom of the container. Do not keep your oysters in a sealed or closed-top container. Doing so will suffocate them. You may need to change your ice during the refrigeration process, so do not pour any into the container if you won't be able to check your oysters regularly. Place your oysters on top of the ice bed deep side down. Just like seafood merchants, you'll be storing your oysters on ice to keep them as chilled and fresh as possible. Make sure to turn each of your oysters so that the deeper side faces down, a technique that will help them better retain their juices. Dampen a towel with cold water and place it on top of the oysters. Dip a thin, clean kitchen towel in cold water and ring out the excess liquid. Then, gently lay the towel on top of the oysters. This will keep the oysters from drying out while preventing fresh water poisoning. If you'd prefer, you can cover the oysters with damp paper towels or newspaper instead. Oysters are salt water creatures, so submerging them in fresh water will essentially poison them and lead to their death. Place your container in a refrigerator. If possible, set your refrigerator to a temperature between 35 and 40 °F (2 and 4 °C). Make sure to store your oysters above any raw meat so the juices don't drip down onto your shellfish. If possible, check on your oysters at least once a day while they're in the fridge. If the towel dries out, dampen it again. If the ice in your container melts, pour it out and replace it with new ice. Keep your oysters in the fridge for up to 2 days. For safety, remove and consume your oysters within about 2 days of initially storing them. Though some oysters may last for a week or longer, eating them that late puts you at greater risk of food poisoning and other unwanted ailments. If your oysters came with an expiration date, use that as your guide for maximum storage time. Freeze your oysters if you need to store them for more than 2 days. Shuck the oysters when you’re ready to eat them. Once you finish storing the oysters, run them under cool water and open their shells. Then, run a knife under the flat side of the oyster and pop the shell off. Before eating, carefully separate the oyster from the rest of the shell using a knife. Before eating an oyster, inspect it to make sure it is still good. If the shell appears to be damaged, if the oyster smells foul, or if the meat is a cloudy shade of grey, brown, black, or pink, throw the oyster away. Keep the oysters in their shells and rinse them off. Storing your oysters inside their shells will make them less likely to go bad and, in some cases, better preserve their taste. Unlike refrigerating oysters, rinsing the shells under cold water to clean them off prevents any bacteria from living on the oysters. If you don't have enough room in your freezer to keep full-shelled oysters, you can shuck them before storage. If you do so, save the internal liquor for later use. Place your oysters in a freezer-safe container. To keep your oysters safe, place them inside a moisture-resistant, freezer-safe bag. If you're storing shucked oysters, you can use a firm plastic container instead. To prevent freezer burns, leave no more than 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of head space in the container. Pour oyster liquor into the container if you’re freezing shucked oysters. To help your shucked oysters retain their juiciness, pour the liquor you removed during the shucking process into your freezer-safe container. Keep pouring until you've completely submerged the oysters inside the liquid. If you don't have enough liquor to fill the container, pour in water as well. Seal the container. If you're using a resealable bag, press any excess air out of it using your fingers. Then, seal your container right before you put it into the freezer. Unlike with refrigerated oysters, closing the container will help better preserve your shellfish during long-term storage. If you're using a solid plastic container, make sure the lid you seal it with is air-tight. Make sure to write the initial storage date on your container. Keep your oysters in the freezer for up to 3 months. When frozen properly, fresh oysters should last for between 2 and 3 months. To make sure your oysters aren't going bad, look over them regularly and remove any that have cracked shells or cloudy meat that is a pink, black, brown, or grey color. While your oysters may remain safe to eat during this time, the taste will degrade gradually. Thaw your oysters in the fridge before consuming. Carefully take your oyster container out of the freezer and place it in a clear, open part of your refrigerator. Depending on the exact temperature of your appliances, the thawing process could take up to 20 hours to complete. Thawing your oysters using this method gives them a slightly longer shelf life, meaning you don't have to use them immediately after they thaw. If you'd like, you can thaw your oysters by submerging their container in cold water. However, you'll have to consume them immediately after they thaw, otherwise they'll go bad. ","This WikiHow article provides comprehensive guidance on properly storing oysters using two primary methods - refrigeration for short-term storage and freezing for longer-term preservation. For refrigerated storage, the article emphasizes that oysters should never be shucked or washed beforehand, as keeping them in their natural shells maintains optimal freshness and makes storage easier while reducing spoilage risk, and any grit or dirt should be left on the shells to retain moisture and insulate the meat. The refrigeration process involves creating an ice bed in an open-top container (never sealed, as this would suffocate the oysters), placing the oysters deep-side down on the ice to help retain their natural juices, covering them with a damp towel to prevent dehydration while avoiding fresh water poisoning (since oysters are saltwater creatures), and storing the container in a refrigerator set between 35-40°F above any raw meat to prevent cross-contamination. Regular maintenance is crucial, requiring daily checks to re-dampen towels and replace melted ice, with consumption recommended within 2 days for safety, though some oysters may last longer. For longer storage needs exceeding 2 days, the freezing method is recommended, which involves keeping oysters in shells and rinsing them clean (unlike refrigeration storage), placing them in moisture-resistant, freezer-safe containers with minimal head space to prevent freezer burn, and for shucked oysters, submerging them in their own liquor or adding water if needed to maintain juiciness. Proper sealing is essential for frozen storage, with containers requiring airtight closure and clear labeling of storage dates, allowing oysters to remain safely frozen for 2-3 months, though taste quality gradually degrades over time. The thawing process should occur slowly in the refrigerator for up to 20 hours, which extends shelf life compared to rapid cold-water thawing that requires immediate consumption, and throughout all storage methods, oysters should be inspected for signs of spoilage including damaged shells, foul odors, or meat that appears cloudy and has turned grey, brown, black, or pink colors.","This WikiHow article provides comprehensive guidance on properly storing oysters using two primary methods - refrigeration for short-term storage and freezing for longer-term preservation.

train_1,How to Tell if a Rolex Watch is Real or Fake,"Listen for the telltale ""tick, tick, tick"" rather than a much more rapid ticking noise. On standard watches, the motion of the second hand is jerky and truncated because the majority of them are quartz watches. The second hand shifts abruptly from each second position to the next. If you listen carefully, you can usually hear a quiet ""tick, tick, tick"" from this motion. On the other hand, Rolexes (and many other fine watches) have second hands that move almost perfectly smoothly because they have automatic movements not quartz. Because of this, Rolex does not make a ""ticking"" noise. If you hear a slow ticking noise coming from your watch, this is a dead giveaway that you're not wearing a real Rolex. The noise you hear should be much faster than a battery operated watch. Look for jerky second hand motion. As noted above, Rolexes have second hands that smoothly sweep across the face of the watch, rather than jerking from one position to the next. Look at your watch's second hand carefully — does it turn smoothly, tracing the path of a perfect circle around the edge of the watch's face? Or does it appear to speed up, slow down, or jerk as it turns? If the second hand's motion is anything less than silky smooth, you may have an imitation on your hands. In fact, if you look extremely closely, a real Rolex's second hand motion isn't perfectly smooth. Many models actually move at a speed of about 8 tiny movements per second. Some models even have slower speeds. To the naked eye, however, this motion is usually undetectable, so the second hand looks like it's moving smoothly. Look for fake ""magnification"" of the date. Many (but not all) Rolex watches have a small dial or window that displays the date. Usually, this is on the right side of the watch face (near the ""three o'clock"" position). To make this dial easier to read, some Rolexes include a small magnification lens (sometimes called a ""cyclops"") in the glass over the dial. This part is difficult to counterfeit, so many fake Rolexes will have something that appears to be a magnification panel, but, on close inspection, is actually only ordinary glass. If the magnification panel over the date dial doesn't actually seem to make the date numbering any larger, you may have a fake. Actual Rolex magnification windows should magnify the date to 2.5x — the date should take up nearly the entire window. Some good counterfeits will magnify the date somewhat but often not to the point that the entire window is filled. They will also not be centered over the date exactly. Be suspicious of a magnification window that looks glued on imperfectly or off center. Loosen the stem and roll back the hands to change the date, it should change to the previous date when it goes down to the 6 position, not at the 12. This is virtually impossible to replicate. If it does not do this it is likely a fake. Feel for a suspiciously light weight. Real Rolexes are constructed from real metal and crystal and thus have some heft to them. They should feel solid and substantial in your hand and on your wrist. If your Rolex feels suspiciously lightweight, it may not be of the highest quality — it may be lacking some of the precious metals used in many models of Rolex or may be constructed entirely from substandard materials. Look for a clear backside to the watch. Some imitation Rolexes feature a clear glass back which allows you to see the inner workings of the watch. This clear backing may or may not be concealed beneath a removable metal cover. In fact, no current models of Rolex contain this sort of clear caseback, so if your watch has this feature, it is not a true Rolex. Only a few Rolexes have ever been made with clear case backings, and these were all exhibition models. It is thought that counterfeiters add this clear caseback to help vendors sell watches to unwitting customers by allowing them to view the workmanship inside the watch. Inexperienced customers may be wowed by the inner workings of the watch, rather than alerted to the fact that something is wrong. Look for non-metal construction. Take your Rolex and turn it over. Examine the back of your watch — it should be made of smooth, unmarked, high-quality metal. If the band is not made of leather, it should be made from high-quality metal construction as well. If any part of the watch's construction is made from plastic or a thin, cheap-looking metal like aluminum, you're dealing with a fake. These qualities are clear signs that corners were cut during the manufacture of the watch. Rolexes are made from only the finest materials. No expense is spared in the creation of each watch. In addition, if the back casing of your watch appears to be made from metal but can be removed to reveal a plastic inner case, the watch isn't genuine. Test the watch's water-tightness. One surefire way to determine whether a supposed Rolex is real or not is to see if it is waterproof. All Rolex watches are made to be perfectly airtight — if your watch leaks even a little bit, it's probably not the real thing. To test whether your watch is waterproof, fill a cup with water, make sure the stem is screwed on tightly and dunk the watch into the cup for several seconds, and take it out. The watch should be working perfectly fine and you shouldn't see any water inside the dial. If you do, you have a fake on your hands. Obviously, if your watch is a fake, this test can harm or even ruin the watch. In the event of water damage, you may be forced to take the watch to an experienced repairman or even buy a new one entirely, so, if you're not comfortable with these possibilities, try to rely on the other tests. Note that the Submariner is the only Rolex watch designed for deep water usage — while other Rolexes should be fine in the shower and the swimming pool, they may leak under more serious aquatic conditions. When all else fails, compare your watch to the real thing. If you're still not sure if your watch is a real Rolex, it can be helpful to compare the way your watch looks to the way it is supposed to look. The Rolex website contains a catalog of all the watches Rolex produces, with multiple pictures for each. Find the model of watch you have on the Rolex site, then compare the appearance of your watch to that of the available ""reference"" images. Pay special attention to the dial — is everything laid out where it should be? If your watch has an extra dial like a chronograph or a date dial, is it in the right place? Are all the inscriptions identical? Is the lettering the same? If you can answer ""no"" to any of these questions, you probably have a fake. Rolex's brand is famous for the quality of its craftsmanship — noticeable errors are extremely rare. Look for the serial number. Some expert-made counterfeits won't be easy to tell apart from actual Rolexes. To spot these, you may need to examine the watch's tiny, intricate detail work, which is the hardest part of the watch to fake. To start, try finding your watch's serial number. This will require you to remove the band. You can usually do this by pushing the joint holding the band to the watch out of its place with a thumbtack or similarly-sized object. However, if you're uncomfortable with this, you can also have a professional do it for you. The serial number should be located between the ""lugs"" at the six o'clock end of the dial. The lettering on the serial number should be perfect and precise, with fine lines. Some counterfeiters use an acid-etching method which produces serial number markings with a noticeable ""sandy"" appearance under magnification. Between the opposite set of lugs, there should be another similar marking. This is the case reference number and will be labeled with the words, ""ORIG ROLEX DESIGN."" An original Rolex will have sharp and detailed engraving located between the lugs. Counterfeiters often try to mimic these engraving, the result often appears like the serial number has been roughly etched into the casing. Note that it's possible to look the date of your watch's manufacture up with your serial number — several handy online sources (like this one ) can help you here. Look for the crown at six o'clock. Starting in the early to mid 2000s, Rolex began etching the trademark crown logo into the crystal of their watch's dials. If your watch was made in the past decade or so, you may be able to see this tiny mark of authenticity. Use a magnifying glass or a jeweler's lens to carefully examine the glass at the six o'clock end of the watch's dial. Look for the Rolex crown logo — the same design as the much larger logo at the opposite end of the dial. The etching you are looking for is very, very small and can be quite tricky to see. You may find that it is easier to see if you shine light at the face of the watch at an angle. Some counterfeiters do attempt to copy this etching, but it is extremely difficult to duplicate with the precision of an actual Rolex. If this etching is large enough to easily see with the naked eye, you may have a fake on your hands. Look for etched inscription inside the rim of the dial. Another mark of authenticity is the fine, etched lettering that is usually included around the rim of Rolex watch dials. Examine this lettering with a magnifying glass or jeweler's lens. The lettering should be fine, precise, and elegant, with no imperfections. Additionally, the lettering should be etched into the metal rim. If it appears to be painted or printed instead, the watch is likely a fake. Note that, typically, all watches from Rolex's Oyster series bear this etching. Watches from the Cellini series often have non-standard designs (rectangular faces, etc.) and thus may not have this etching. Look for a high-quality crown logo on the dial. Almost (though not quite ) all Rolex watches have the trademark crown logo located at the top of the dial near the twelve o'clock marking. Examining this logo under magnification can sometimes reveal a fake. The logo should appear to made of high-quality metal construction. The circles at the end of the crown's points should have raised bumps. The outline of the crown should glimmer with a different metallic sheen than the inside. If your crown logo looks cheap or flat under magnification, this is a sign of poor craftsmanship (and a likely indicator of a fake). Look for perfectly precise lettering on the dial. Rolexes are renowned for their perfection. Even small, relatively undetectable defects can be clues that your Rolex isn't top quality. Examine the lettering on your watch's dial with a magnifying glass or jeweler's lens. Each letter should be perfectly, precisely formed with straight lines and smooth curves. The spaces between words and letters should be consistent. If you notice that any letters seem to be even slightly uneven or smudged under magnification, this is a sign that the watch was made with sub-optimal printing technology and is probably not a Rolex. It's also worth mentioning that, obviously, any sort of misspelling is also a dead giveaway that the watch is a fake. Beware sub-par packaging. Everything about a Rolex watch should be elegant, dignified, and perfect. This even includes the packaging. Real Rolexes come in fine jewelry boxes which usually include a mount to hold and display the watch as well as a small cloth to clean and polish it. All packaging should bear the official Rolex name and logo. The watch should also come with a manual and warranty paperwork. If your watch is missing any of these things, it may not be genuine. Buying a watch by itself off the street is a complete crap shoot — since there's no packaging, there's no way to tell it's authentic. Beware shady locations. When shopping for Rolexes, use common sense. A reputable jeweler or a fine watch dealer is much, much more likely to be selling genuine Rolexes than a street vendor. Rolexes can cost thousands of dollars, so it's safe to assume that anyone who sells them will have the resources to own a legitimate business. If you're unsure whether a certain retailer is a reputable Rolex seller, consult Rolex's online listing of certified retailers here. Pawn shops can be a mixed bag — they may have genuine Rolexes, but they may not, depending on the individuals who sold the shop the watches. Some pawn shops take efforts to ensure that they only sell genuine watches, while others may turn a blind eye to counterfeits. If you don't know whether a certain pawn shop can be trusted, try to find online reviews and testimonials for the store before making your purchase. Beware unusually cheap prices. When it comes to buying Rolexes, if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Rolex watches are fine-made luxury goods crafted to perfection — they're never cheap. The most expensive Rolex watches in the world sell for over a million dollars, while even some of the cheapest models can sell for over $4000. If you're being offered a Rolex for $100 dollars, it doesn't matter what the seller's explanation is — there's either something wrong with the watch or it's not the real thing. Don't accept an unscrupulous seller's excuses. If you're being told that a Rolex watch is being sold for cheap because the seller found it or because it was given as a gift, walk away. Assume that there are no lucky coincidences when spending the kind of money that it takes to purchase a Rolex. When all else fails, take your watch to an experienced jeweler. Sometimes, even when you know what to look for, it's almost impossible to tell whether a watch is the real deal or a fake. In these cases, a knowledgeable, trustworthy jeweler or watch salesman can help you by examining the watch for qualities that the ordinary person can't catch. If you have a great relationship with this expert, you may be able to have your watch's genuineness judged for free. Otherwise, jewelry appraisal services, while not cheap, are fairly affordable when compared to the price of a Rolex. For instance, some jewelry appraisal services can run at a cost of up to $180 per hour. Because of this, you may want to have multiple items appraised at once to get the greatest possible value. Only use jewelry appraisal services that charge by the hour, on a per-piece basis, or for a contracted amount based on the estimated time needed. Never use appraisers that charge a percentage of the jewelry's value — this is a scamming technique. Finished.  ","This WikiHow article provides comprehensive guidance on authenticating Rolex watches by examining multiple physical and functional characteristics that distinguish genuine Rolexes from counterfeits. The article begins by instructing readers to listen for audio cues, explaining that authentic Rolexes with automatic movements produce a much faster ticking sound compared to the slower ""tick, tick, tick"" of quartz watches, and to observe the second hand's movement, which should sweep smoothly across the watch face rather than jerking between positions, though genuine Rolexes actually move at about 8 tiny movements per second that appear smooth to the naked eye. The guide emphasizes examining the date magnification feature, noting that authentic Rolex ""cyclops"" lenses should magnify the date to 2.5 times its normal size, filling nearly the entire window and being perfectly centered, while fakes often have non-functional or improperly positioned magnification panels. A crucial test involves loosening the stem and rolling back the hands to change the date, which should change to the previous date when the hands reach the 6 o'clock position rather than at 12 o'clock, a feature that's virtually impossible to replicate in counterfeits. The article advises checking the watch's weight, as genuine Rolexes should feel substantial due to their real metal and crystal construction, and warns against clear casebacks, which are not found in current Rolex models except for rare exhibition pieces. Material quality is emphasized, with instructions to examine the back casing and band for high-quality metal construction rather than plastic or cheap aluminum components, and the guide includes a water-tightness test where the watch should remain perfectly functional after being submerged in water for several seconds. For visual comparison, the article recommends using the official Rolex website catalog to compare watch appearance, dial layout, chronograph positioning, and lettering against reference images. The guide then delves into examining intricate details that are hardest to counterfeit, including locating the serial number between the lugs at the six o'clock position, which should feature perfect, precise lettering rather than the sandy appearance of acid-etched counterfeits, and finding the case reference number with ""ORIG ROLEX DESIGN"" marking between the opposite lugs. Additional authentication markers include the tiny crown logo etched into the crystal at six o'clock (added in the early to mid-2000s), fine lettering etched around the dial rim in Oyster series watches, a high-quality crown logo at twelve o'clock with raised bumps and different metallic sheens, and perfectly precise dial lettering with consistent spacing and no smudging or misspellings. The article extends beyond the watch itself to packaging considerations, noting that genuine Rolexes come with elegant jewelry boxes, display mounts, cleaning cloths, manuals, and warranty paperwork bearing official Rolex branding. Purchasing advice includes avoiding shady locations like street vendors in favor of reputable jewelers and certified retailers listed on Rolex's website, being cautious with pawn shops that may vary in their authentication efforts, and being suspicious of unusually cheap prices since even the least expensive Rolex models cost over $4,000 while the most expensive exceed one million dollars. The guide concludes by recommending professional authentication through experienced jewelers or watch salesmen when personal examination proves insufficient, suggesting jewelry appraisal services that charge hourly rates (up to $180 per hour) or per-piece fees rather than percentage-based pricing, and advising readers to have multiple items appraised simultaneously for better value.","This WikiHow article provides comprehensive guidance on authenticating Rolex watches by examining multiple physical and functional characteristics that distinguish genuine Rolexes from counterfeits.

A crucial test involves loosening the stem and rolling back the hands to change the date, which should change to the previous date when the hands reach the 6 o'clock position rather than at 12 o'clock, a feature that's virtually impossible to replicate in counterfeits. The article advises checking the watch's weight, as genuine Rolexes should feel substantial due to their real metal and crystal construction, and warns against clear casebacks, which are not found in current Rolex models except for rare exhibition pieces. Material quality is emphasized, with instructions to examine the back casing and band for high-quality metal construction rather than plastic or cheap aluminum components, and the guide includes a water-tightness test where the watch should remain perfectly functional after being submerged in water for several seconds. For visual comparison, the article recommends using the official Rolex website catalog to compare watch appearance, dial layout, chronograph positioning, and lettering against reference images. The guide then delves into examining intricate details that are hardest to counterfeit, including locating the serial number between the lugs at the six o'clock position, which should feature perfect, precise lettering rather than the sandy appearance of acid-etched counterfeits, and finding the case reference number with ""ORIG ROLEX DESIGN"" marking between the opposite lugs. Additional authentication markers include the tiny crown logo etched into the crystal at six o'clock (added in the early to mid-2000s), fine lettering etched around the dial rim in Oyster series watches, a high-quality crown logo at twelve o'clock with raised bumps and different metallic sheens, and perfectly precise dial lettering with consistent spacing and no smudging or misspellings. The article extends beyond the watch itself to packaging considerations, noting that genuine Rolexes come with elegant jewelry boxes, display mounts, cleaning cloths, manuals, and warranty paperwork bearing official Rolex branding. Purchasing advice includes avoiding shady locations like street vendors in favor of reputable jewelers and certified retailers listed on Rolex's website, being cautious with pawn shops that may vary in their authentication efforts, and being suspicious of unusually cheap prices since even the least expensive Rolex models cost over $4,000 while the most expensive exceed one million dollars. The guide concludes by recommending professional authentication through experienced jewelers or watch salesmen when personal examination proves insufficient, suggesting jewelry appraisal services that charge hourly rates (up to $180 per hour) or per-piece fees rather than percentage-based pricing, and advising readers to have multiple items appraised simultaneously for better value.","thiS wiKiHow arTicle prOVides comprehensivE guidance on AutheNtIcatinG roLex waTcHes bY exaMining multiple phySicAl aND functional chAraCTerisTics That DisTinGuIsH geNUine rOlexes from COuNterFeitS. tHe articLe begiNS by inStruCting REaders To listen for audIO cues, exPlaiNing that aUThEntic roLexeS wIth automAtic mOVemEntS pRoduce a MuCh fasteR tIcking SOund CompaRed to the sloweR ""ticK, tick, tICK"" of QuartZ waTCHes, anD To ObsErve the seCond hanD's moVEmEnt, WhicH should sweep smoOthly acRoss the watCh face RatHER tHAn JerkinG betwEen pOsitioNs, thoUgh genuiNe roLexes ACtually Move at aBOUt 8 tiNy moVements peR secOnd That appeAr smoOth to thE naked eyE. thE Guide emPhasizeS exaMiNing tHe date mAgnificatIon fEature, NoTing ThaT auThentic Rolex","THIS WIKIHOW ARTICLE PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE GUIDANCE ON AUTHENTICATING ROLEX WATCHES BY EXAMINING MULTIPLE PHYSICAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS THAT DISTINGUISH GENUINE ROLEXES FROM COUNTERFEITS.

train_2,How to Ship a Bicycle Cheaply,"Use an Allen key to unscrew the handlebars from the bike. Put the Allen key into the screw on the front of your handlebars. Turn the wrench counterclockwise to loosen the screw. Once it's loose, you should be able to lift your handlebars from their housing. Place the screws and bolts in a zip lock bag to keep the smaller parts together for when you want to reassemble the bike later. Remove the pedals. Depending on what kind of pedals you have, you'll need either an Allen key or a 15mm wrench. Press down on the pedal with your foot and hold the brake to prevent your bike and pedals from moving. Bend down and insert the Allen key or use the wrench to loosen the bolt on the opposite side of the pedal. Continue to unscrew the bolt until the pedal comes off. You may need a friend to help you hold the bike in place while you unscrew the pedals. Remove the front wheel. If you have a quick-release wheel, all you'll need to do is undo the latch on the front of the wheel and turn the latch counterclockwise to loosen the wheel. If your wheel is secured with a bolt, you'll need a 15mm wrench to remove it. Loosen the bolt on the center of the wheel by turning the wrench counter-clockwise. You may have to loosen the brakes to remove the wheel. Unscrew and take off your seat. Find the bolts that are holding your seat to the frame of the bike and remove them with an Allen key. These bolts will be somewhere under the seat. Some bikes will have two bolts that you need to undo while others will just have one. Turn the key counterclockwise to loosen the bolt until the seat comes off. Your bike should now be mostly unassembled and ready for transport. Let the air out of your tires by pressing the needle on the nozzle. Deflate your tires to make more room in your shipping container for the rest of the bike. Doing this will also prevent the tubes from popping while you're shipping it. Unscrew the caps on your bike's tires and softly press down on the needle in the center of the valve to release the air from the tires. Don't squeeze your tires before you depress the needle or you may damage them. Get a cardboard bike box at a bike shop. Find a box made for the same style of bike that you have. See if you can try to get the box for free. If the bike shop doesn't have any boxes, you can purchase one online for a low fee. Purchase a bike travel case for more expensive bikes. Bike travel cases are more expensive than a cardboard box but provide additional protection for your bike. If you are shipping a more expensive bike, consider using a travel case. This may save you money in the long run because you won't have to pay for costly bike repairs. Purchase and cut plumbing insulation to the size of your frame. Purchase pipe insulation online or at a hardware store. This foam material can wrap around the frame of your bike and prevent it from getting damaged during transport. Measure the length on the different parts of your bike's frame and cut the foam insulation to the same size. If you're trying to save even more money, you can use bubble wrap instead of plumbing insulation. Tape or tie the insulation around your bike frame. Wrap the insulation around the frame of your bike and wrap duct tape or zip ties around the insulation and frame. This will secure the foam insulation to your bike's frame and hold it in place. Wrap loose parts with bubble wrap. Take your wheel, handlebars, and pedals and wrap them with bubble wrap. Secure the wrap with tape and set them aside. You should also cover any remaining exposed parts of your bike with whatever bubble wrap you have left over. Place the frame of the bike into the container first. Place the bike's frame and back wheel into the top of the container. Double check to make sure that your bike box is large enough to accommodate the bike's size. If you have a heavy bike, you may need someone to help hold the box in place as you put the frame in it. Place the rest of the parts into the container. Carefully place the rest of the parts into the container, sliding them up as close to the frame as possible. Once you position all of the parts, close the box and make sure that the sides are not bulging. If the sides are bulging, see if you can rearrange the parts in the box so that it doesn't. If the frame is causing the sides of the box to bulge, you'll need a larger box. Tape the box closed. Close all the flaps on the box and apply several coats of tape over the flaps. Once you feel like the box is secure, you're done packing away your bike. Decide which shipping company you want to use. Compare the prices from different shipping companies so that you can find the cheapest option. Major shipping companies like FedEx, USPS, and UPS can ship your bike for a fee. There are also other services like Bikeflights, Sports Express, and Shipbikes.com that specifically ship bicycles. Measure the dimensions of your bike and determine how much each service would cost. Print out a shipping label. You can usually calculate the cost and print and pay for shipping online. Go to the website for the shipping company that you're going to use and fill out the order information. Tape your shipping label to the box securely. Make sure to go over the front of the label with a clear masking tape so that the label won't get damaged in transit. If you can't print the label online, you'll have to visit a shipping facility. Have the bike's destination on hand when filling out the shipping label. Some companies won't ship your box unless all over the edges of the shipping label are securely taped to the box. Take your bike to a shipping facility and pay the fee to send it. Take your package and bring it to the closest shipping facility. If you weren't able to get a label online, you can now get one at the facility. They will weigh and measure the package for you and then tell you how much it will cost. Shipping a bike that weighs 50 pounds (23 kg) can cost anywhere from $100-$400. Keep your shipping container as small as possible. Some shipping companies will charge you based on the size of your box, not the weight of your bike. If your shipping company is charging by box size, choose the smallest box you can find. Use basic shipping. Most of the time shipping companies will have a slower ground option that you can choose. Choosing this option will usually take longer but will cost you less. Take your bike on an airline flight. Check the regulations and fees associated with traveling with your bike. Some airlines offer to transport your bike in the plane. This prevents the likelihood the bike will get lost and can sometimes cost less than shipping it. Consider insuring your bike if it's expensive. While the price of insurance will raise your overall cost, it will prevent you from having to buy a new one if it's lost in transit. This is especially useful if you're shipping the bike internationally. ","This comprehensive WikiHow article provides detailed instructions for disassembling, packing, and shipping a bicycle, beginning with the systematic removal of key components using basic tools like Allen keys and 15mm wrenches to detach handlebars by turning screws counterclockwise, removing pedals while holding brakes and potentially requiring assistance to stabilize the bike, taking off the front wheel either through quick-release mechanisms or bolt removal (possibly requiring brake adjustment), and unscrewing the seat by locating and loosening the one or two bolts underneath it with an Allen key, followed by deflating the tires by pressing the needle valve to prevent tube damage and create more space in the shipping container. The article then transitions to packaging preparation, recommending acquiring a cardboard bike box from a local bike shop (preferably free) that matches your bike style, or alternatively purchasing a more expensive but protective bike travel case for valuable bicycles, while also obtaining plumbing insulation or bubble wrap to protect the frame by measuring, cutting, and securing foam padding around various frame sections with duct tape or zip ties, and wrapping all loose components like wheels, handlebars, and pedals in bubble wrap secured with tape. The packing process involves carefully placing the frame and rear wheel into the container first (ensuring proper fit and potentially requiring assistance for heavy bikes), followed by strategically positioning all remaining wrapped components as close to the frame as possible while ensuring the box sides don't bulge, and if bulging occurs, rearranging parts or obtaining a larger container before securely taping all flaps with multiple layers. Finally, the article covers shipping logistics including comparing prices among major carriers like FedEx, USPS, UPS, or specialized bicycle shipping services such as Bikeflights, Sports Express, and Shipbikes.com, calculating costs based on measurements and weight, printing shipping labels online when possible and securing them with clear tape over all edges, taking the packaged bike to a shipping facility where costs can range from $100-$400 for a 50-pound bike, and concludes with money-saving tips such as using the smallest possible container when charged by size rather than weight, selecting slower ground shipping options, considering airline transport as an alternative, and purchasing insurance for expensive bikes especially for international shipping.","This comprehensive WikiHow article provides detailed instructions for disassembling, packing, and shipping a bicycle, beginning with the systematic removal of key components using basic tools like Allen keys and 15mm wrenches to detach handlebars by turning screws counterclockwise, removing pedals while holding brakes and potentially requiring assistance to stabilize the bike, taking off the front wheel either through quick-release mechanisms or bolt removal (possibly requiring brake adjustment),","This comprehensive WikiHow article provides detailed instructions for disassembling, packing, and shipping a bicycle, beginning with the systematic removal of key components using basic tools like Allen keys and 15mm wrenches to detach handlebars by turning screws counterclockwise, removing pedals while holding brakes and potentially requiring assistance to stabilize the bike, taking off the front wheel either through quick-release mechanisms or bolt removal (possibly requiring brake adjustment), and unscrewing the seat by locating and loosening the one or two bolts underneath it with an Allen key, followed by deflating the tires by pressing the needle valve to prevent tube damage and create more space in the shipping container.

train_3,How to Seal Pavers,"Choose a water-based sealer if your pavers are laid with joint sand. Water-based sealers are sprayed on and give an even coverage. The main benefit of a water-based sealer is that it hardens the joint sand and penetrates into pavers better. This ends up creating a hard seal over the entire paved area. Water-based sealers do not darken the stones or give a high amount of shine to the pavers. Choose this sealer for bricks that are porous and won't shine much anyway. If you are unsure what type of pavers you have or you aren't sure which sealer is best, consult a home improvement store employee. Water-based sealers often require that you apply more than one coat to the paved area. Buy a solvent sealer to darken stones and make them shine. Solvent sealers can give a much higher gloss to the stones than water-based sealers. The downside is that they do not harden sand as effectively. This sealer is great for smooth, non-porous stones. If your pavers are laid tightly together without joint sand, this is a good option. Solvent sealers are often thicker than water-based sealers, so you may be required to use a roller rather than a sprayer. Read the instructions for proper application. Sealers may be sprayed on with a pump sprayer, laid with a nap roller, or a combination of both. Follow the instructions on the sealer you buy to use the proper tools. Thin sealers can often be sprayed on, which is much faster. Thicker sealers may need to be rolled, which can be slower and won't always cover as evenly. Some sealers are sprayed on but require that you backroll the pavers to even out the coating. Use a sprayer with an adjustable nozzle head. For best application, you want a nice wide fan spray, so be sure that the sprayer you use has either multiple head attachments or an adjustable spray pattern. Never use a sprayer that shoots a narrow stream. A bug sprayer is a good option for this. They are widely available at hardware stores, and they are often inexpensive. Use a roller of appropriate thickness. Many sealers will require that you lay them with a roller rather than a sprayer, and in this case it is important that the roller is thick enough. The sealer will most likely give you instructions about this. For example, one sealer might suggest a roller with a 1” thick nap. This is important because if the roller is not thick enough, the sealer will not get down into the cracks between the pavers and thus won't seal as well as it should. A roller that is too thick might coat the sealer on too thickly as well, and you won't get an even coat across the pavers. Wash the pavers. Sealing without cleaning first is only going to seal dirt and grime into the pavers. You can power wash the pavers, as long as there isn't sand in between that would be washed away. You could use some dish soap and hot water for areas that have oil or tire marks from cars. A stiff broom will help scrub the pavers clean. Let the pavers dry for at least 24 hours before you continue. The type of pavers and the way they are laid will determine the best washing method. If the pavers are packed tightly together, power washing is a great option, but not if the pavers are laid with sand between them. It's rarely a good idea to sand-blast pavers. If the pavers make up a driveway that has a lot of car traffic, wash the pavers more thoroughly to get as much of the grime off as you can. Smooth pavers that don't retain much grime might be sufficiently cleaned with a quick broom sweeping. Level crooked pavers. Sometimes pavers settle unevenly, which creates a tripping hazard in areas that people frequently walk. Lift any uneven pavers and level the spot where they're sitting by adding or removing sand under the paver. If your pavers are laid tightly together, lifting any of them up to even them out may not be an option. Still, sealing is more effective when the pavers are all level. Seal the pavers one section at a time. To make sure you cover the whole paver area, work in a specific pattern. A good option can be going around the entire outer edge of the area first to establish a border, then dividing the rest of the area into 3-5 sections depending on how big it is. For example, a 100 square foot patio could be done in four 5ftx5ft sections. Start at a corner farthest away from your exit, and work your way out towards the exit. This will keep you from walking across the sealant at the end. Move the sprayer nozzle in a circular motion. The sealer will make stones appear darker when they get wet, but it can still be helpful to use a consistent motion. You can move the spraying nozzle in circles for the best coverage. You don't want to cover some areas with more sealer than others, so it is important to pay attention to what stones you cover as you spray. Try not to use too much sealer, as it will take longer to dry. A light layer is all you need. If you are working in a small area, you may not have a hard time keeping track of what you have sealed, but if you are doing an entire driveway it becomes more important. Finish the whole job at once. Sealing pavers is not the kind of thing you want to break up into multiple rounds of work. If you don't do the whole thing at one time, it's likely that you will lose track of where you have already sealed. The amount of time it takes you to seal the entire area will depend on how big it is. A small patio may only take 20 minutes, but an entire driveway will likely take you a couple of hours. Clean the sprayer or roller. Rinse the sprayer or roller thoroughly immediately after you finish the project. If you let the sealer sit for too long it will harden on your equipment. If you don't want to wash the roller, you can throw it away. Make sure to spray water through the nozzle until the water runs clear to clean the hose as well. When you read the sealer instructions, see if there are any special instructions about cleaning equipment. You may need lacquer thinner or something stronger than water to clean the sealer out of your sprayer. ","This WikiHow article provides comprehensive guidance on sealing pavers, beginning with the crucial decision between water-based and solvent sealers based on your specific paver installation and desired outcome. Water-based sealers are recommended for pavers laid with joint sand because they effectively harden the sand, penetrate deeply into porous materials, and create a uniform hard seal across the entire surface without darkening stones or adding significant shine, making them ideal for porous bricks that naturally don't reflect much light, though they often require multiple coats for optimal coverage. Conversely, solvent sealers are better suited for smooth, non-porous stones or pavers installed tightly without joint sand, as they excel at darkening stones and creating a high-gloss finish, though they're less effective at hardening sand and are typically thicker, often requiring roller application rather than spraying. The article emphasizes the importance of using proper application tools, including sprayers with adjustable nozzle heads that produce wide fan spray patterns (bug sprayers are recommended as affordable, accessible options) and rollers of appropriate thickness as specified by the sealer manufacturer to ensure the product penetrates cracks between pavers without applying too thick a coat. Thorough preparation is essential, involving washing pavers to remove dirt and grime that would otherwise be sealed in permanently, using methods ranging from power washing (suitable for tightly packed pavers) to dish soap and hot water for oil stains, followed by a mandatory 24-hour drying period, with washing intensity varying based on paver type and traffic exposure. The article also recommends leveling any crooked or settled pavers before sealing to eliminate tripping hazards and improve seal effectiveness, though this may not be possible with tightly installed pavers. The actual sealing process should be approached systematically, working in sections with a clear pattern such as establishing outer borders first then dividing the remaining area into manageable sections (like 5x5 foot squares for a 100 square foot patio), always starting from the corner farthest from your exit point to avoid walking on freshly sealed surfaces. When applying sealer with a sprayer, circular motions ensure consistent coverage while preventing over-application, with the sealer's darkening effect on wet stones serving as a visual guide, though care must be taken to apply only light, even layers to facilitate proper drying. The entire sealing job must be completed in one session to maintain consistency and avoid losing track of previously sealed areas, with project duration ranging from 20 minutes for small patios to several hours for full driveways. Finally, immediate and thorough equipment cleaning is crucial, requiring water rinsing until runoff is clear for sprayers (including hoses and nozzles) and either cleaning or disposal of rollers, with some sealers requiring special cleaning agents like lacquer thinner as specified in manufacturer instructions.","This WikiHow article provides comprehensive guidance on sealing pavers, beginning with the crucial decision between water-based and solvent sealers based on your specific paver installation and desired outcome.
