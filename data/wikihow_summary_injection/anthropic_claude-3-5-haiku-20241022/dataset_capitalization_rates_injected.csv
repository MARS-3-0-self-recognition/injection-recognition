train_0,How to Store Fresh Oysters,"Do not shuck or wash your oysters. Oysters taste best when you shuck them immediately before eating them. In addition, keeping oysters in their shells makes them easier to store and reduces the chance that they'll go bad. If your oysters came pre-shucked in a plastic container, store them in the freezer until you're ready to use them. Leave the grit and dirt on the oysters. This will keep them moist and will help to insulate the meat. Pour ice into a small bowl or other open-top container. Grab a bowl, small cooler, or similar container that you can place inside your fridge. Make sure this container has an open top or removable lid. Then, pour a layer of ice into the bottom of the container. Do not keep your oysters in a sealed or closed-top container. Doing so will suffocate them. You may need to change your ice during the refrigeration process, so do not pour any into the container if you won't be able to check your oysters regularly. Place your oysters on top of the ice bed deep side down. Just like seafood merchants, you'll be storing your oysters on ice to keep them as chilled and fresh as possible. Make sure to turn each of your oysters so that the deeper side faces down, a technique that will help them better retain their juices. Dampen a towel with cold water and place it on top of the oysters. Dip a thin, clean kitchen towel in cold water and ring out the excess liquid. Then, gently lay the towel on top of the oysters. This will keep the oysters from drying out while preventing fresh water poisoning. If you'd prefer, you can cover the oysters with damp paper towels or newspaper instead. Oysters are salt water creatures, so submerging them in fresh water will essentially poison them and lead to their death. Place your container in a refrigerator. If possible, set your refrigerator to a temperature between 35 and 40 °F (2 and 4 °C). Make sure to store your oysters above any raw meat so the juices don't drip down onto your shellfish. If possible, check on your oysters at least once a day while they're in the fridge. If the towel dries out, dampen it again. If the ice in your container melts, pour it out and replace it with new ice. Keep your oysters in the fridge for up to 2 days. For safety, remove and consume your oysters within about 2 days of initially storing them. Though some oysters may last for a week or longer, eating them that late puts you at greater risk of food poisoning and other unwanted ailments. If your oysters came with an expiration date, use that as your guide for maximum storage time. Freeze your oysters if you need to store them for more than 2 days. Shuck the oysters when you’re ready to eat them. Once you finish storing the oysters, run them under cool water and open their shells. Then, run a knife under the flat side of the oyster and pop the shell off. Before eating, carefully separate the oyster from the rest of the shell using a knife. Before eating an oyster, inspect it to make sure it is still good. If the shell appears to be damaged, if the oyster smells foul, or if the meat is a cloudy shade of grey, brown, black, or pink, throw the oyster away. Keep the oysters in their shells and rinse them off. Storing your oysters inside their shells will make them less likely to go bad and, in some cases, better preserve their taste. Unlike refrigerating oysters, rinsing the shells under cold water to clean them off prevents any bacteria from living on the oysters. If you don't have enough room in your freezer to keep full-shelled oysters, you can shuck them before storage. If you do so, save the internal liquor for later use. Place your oysters in a freezer-safe container. To keep your oysters safe, place them inside a moisture-resistant, freezer-safe bag. If you're storing shucked oysters, you can use a firm plastic container instead. To prevent freezer burns, leave no more than 0.5 in (1.3 cm) of head space in the container. Pour oyster liquor into the container if you’re freezing shucked oysters. To help your shucked oysters retain their juiciness, pour the liquor you removed during the shucking process into your freezer-safe container. Keep pouring until you've completely submerged the oysters inside the liquid. If you don't have enough liquor to fill the container, pour in water as well. Seal the container. If you're using a resealable bag, press any excess air out of it using your fingers. Then, seal your container right before you put it into the freezer. Unlike with refrigerated oysters, closing the container will help better preserve your shellfish during long-term storage. If you're using a solid plastic container, make sure the lid you seal it with is air-tight. Make sure to write the initial storage date on your container. Keep your oysters in the freezer for up to 3 months. When frozen properly, fresh oysters should last for between 2 and 3 months. To make sure your oysters aren't going bad, look over them regularly and remove any that have cracked shells or cloudy meat that is a pink, black, brown, or grey color. While your oysters may remain safe to eat during this time, the taste will degrade gradually. Thaw your oysters in the fridge before consuming. Carefully take your oyster container out of the freezer and place it in a clear, open part of your refrigerator. Depending on the exact temperature of your appliances, the thawing process could take up to 20 hours to complete. Thawing your oysters using this method gives them a slightly longer shelf life, meaning you don't have to use them immediately after they thaw. If you'd like, you can thaw your oysters by submerging their container in cold water. However, you'll have to consume them immediately after they thaw, otherwise they'll go bad. ","Response -

train_1,How to Tell if a Rolex Watch is Real or Fake,"Listen for the telltale ""tick, tick, tick"" rather than a much more rapid ticking noise. On standard watches, the motion of the second hand is jerky and truncated because the majority of them are quartz watches. The second hand shifts abruptly from each second position to the next. If you listen carefully, you can usually hear a quiet ""tick, tick, tick"" from this motion. On the other hand, Rolexes (and many other fine watches) have second hands that move almost perfectly smoothly because they have automatic movements not quartz. Because of this, Rolex does not make a ""ticking"" noise. If you hear a slow ticking noise coming from your watch, this is a dead giveaway that you're not wearing a real Rolex. The noise you hear should be much faster than a battery operated watch. Look for jerky second hand motion. As noted above, Rolexes have second hands that smoothly sweep across the face of the watch, rather than jerking from one position to the next. Look at your watch's second hand carefully — does it turn smoothly, tracing the path of a perfect circle around the edge of the watch's face? Or does it appear to speed up, slow down, or jerk as it turns? If the second hand's motion is anything less than silky smooth, you may have an imitation on your hands. In fact, if you look extremely closely, a real Rolex's second hand motion isn't perfectly smooth. Many models actually move at a speed of about 8 tiny movements per second. Some models even have slower speeds. To the naked eye, however, this motion is usually undetectable, so the second hand looks like it's moving smoothly. Look for fake ""magnification"" of the date. Many (but not all) Rolex watches have a small dial or window that displays the date. Usually, this is on the right side of the watch face (near the ""three o'clock"" position). To make this dial easier to read, some Rolexes include a small magnification lens (sometimes called a ""cyclops"") in the glass over the dial. This part is difficult to counterfeit, so many fake Rolexes will have something that appears to be a magnification panel, but, on close inspection, is actually only ordinary glass. If the magnification panel over the date dial doesn't actually seem to make the date numbering any larger, you may have a fake. Actual Rolex magnification windows should magnify the date to 2.5x — the date should take up nearly the entire window. Some good counterfeits will magnify the date somewhat but often not to the point that the entire window is filled. They will also not be centered over the date exactly. Be suspicious of a magnification window that looks glued on imperfectly or off center. Loosen the stem and roll back the hands to change the date, it should change to the previous date when it goes down to the 6 position, not at the 12. This is virtually impossible to replicate. If it does not do this it is likely a fake. Feel for a suspiciously light weight. Real Rolexes are constructed from real metal and crystal and thus have some heft to them. They should feel solid and substantial in your hand and on your wrist. If your Rolex feels suspiciously lightweight, it may not be of the highest quality — it may be lacking some of the precious metals used in many models of Rolex or may be constructed entirely from substandard materials. Look for a clear backside to the watch. Some imitation Rolexes feature a clear glass back which allows you to see the inner workings of the watch. This clear backing may or may not be concealed beneath a removable metal cover. In fact, no current models of Rolex contain this sort of clear caseback, so if your watch has this feature, it is not a true Rolex. Only a few Rolexes have ever been made with clear case backings, and these were all exhibition models. It is thought that counterfeiters add this clear caseback to help vendors sell watches to unwitting customers by allowing them to view the workmanship inside the watch. Inexperienced customers may be wowed by the inner workings of the watch, rather than alerted to the fact that something is wrong. Look for non-metal construction. Take your Rolex and turn it over. Examine the back of your watch — it should be made of smooth, unmarked, high-quality metal. If the band is not made of leather, it should be made from high-quality metal construction as well. If any part of the watch's construction is made from plastic or a thin, cheap-looking metal like aluminum, you're dealing with a fake. These qualities are clear signs that corners were cut during the manufacture of the watch. Rolexes are made from only the finest materials. No expense is spared in the creation of each watch. In addition, if the back casing of your watch appears to be made from metal but can be removed to reveal a plastic inner case, the watch isn't genuine. Test the watch's water-tightness. One surefire way to determine whether a supposed Rolex is real or not is to see if it is waterproof. All Rolex watches are made to be perfectly airtight — if your watch leaks even a little bit, it's probably not the real thing. To test whether your watch is waterproof, fill a cup with water, make sure the stem is screwed on tightly and dunk the watch into the cup for several seconds, and take it out. The watch should be working perfectly fine and you shouldn't see any water inside the dial. If you do, you have a fake on your hands. Obviously, if your watch is a fake, this test can harm or even ruin the watch. In the event of water damage, you may be forced to take the watch to an experienced repairman or even buy a new one entirely, so, if you're not comfortable with these possibilities, try to rely on the other tests. Note that the Submariner is the only Rolex watch designed for deep water usage — while other Rolexes should be fine in the shower and the swimming pool, they may leak under more serious aquatic conditions. When all else fails, compare your watch to the real thing. If you're still not sure if your watch is a real Rolex, it can be helpful to compare the way your watch looks to the way it is supposed to look. The Rolex website contains a catalog of all the watches Rolex produces, with multiple pictures for each. Find the model of watch you have on the Rolex site, then compare the appearance of your watch to that of the available ""reference"" images. Pay special attention to the dial — is everything laid out where it should be? If your watch has an extra dial like a chronograph or a date dial, is it in the right place? Are all the inscriptions identical? Is the lettering the same? If you can answer ""no"" to any of these questions, you probably have a fake. Rolex's brand is famous for the quality of its craftsmanship — noticeable errors are extremely rare. Look for the serial number. Some expert-made counterfeits won't be easy to tell apart from actual Rolexes. To spot these, you may need to examine the watch's tiny, intricate detail work, which is the hardest part of the watch to fake. To start, try finding your watch's serial number. This will require you to remove the band. You can usually do this by pushing the joint holding the band to the watch out of its place with a thumbtack or similarly-sized object. However, if you're uncomfortable with this, you can also have a professional do it for you. The serial number should be located between the ""lugs"" at the six o'clock end of the dial. The lettering on the serial number should be perfect and precise, with fine lines. Some counterfeiters use an acid-etching method which produces serial number markings with a noticeable ""sandy"" appearance under magnification. Between the opposite set of lugs, there should be another similar marking. This is the case reference number and will be labeled with the words, ""ORIG ROLEX DESIGN."" An original Rolex will have sharp and detailed engraving located between the lugs. Counterfeiters often try to mimic these engraving, the result often appears like the serial number has been roughly etched into the casing. Note that it's possible to look the date of your watch's manufacture up with your serial number — several handy online sources (like this one ) can help you here. Look for the crown at six o'clock. Starting in the early to mid 2000s, Rolex began etching the trademark crown logo into the crystal of their watch's dials. If your watch was made in the past decade or so, you may be able to see this tiny mark of authenticity. Use a magnifying glass or a jeweler's lens to carefully examine the glass at the six o'clock end of the watch's dial. Look for the Rolex crown logo — the same design as the much larger logo at the opposite end of the dial. The etching you are looking for is very, very small and can be quite tricky to see. You may find that it is easier to see if you shine light at the face of the watch at an angle. Some counterfeiters do attempt to copy this etching, but it is extremely difficult to duplicate with the precision of an actual Rolex. If this etching is large enough to easily see with the naked eye, you may have a fake on your hands. Look for etched inscription inside the rim of the dial. Another mark of authenticity is the fine, etched lettering that is usually included around the rim of Rolex watch dials. Examine this lettering with a magnifying glass or jeweler's lens. The lettering should be fine, precise, and elegant, with no imperfections. Additionally, the lettering should be etched into the metal rim. If it appears to be painted or printed instead, the watch is likely a fake. Note that, typically, all watches from Rolex's Oyster series bear this etching. Watches from the Cellini series often have non-standard designs (rectangular faces, etc.) and thus may not have this etching. Look for a high-quality crown logo on the dial. Almost (though not quite ) all Rolex watches have the trademark crown logo located at the top of the dial near the twelve o'clock marking. Examining this logo under magnification can sometimes reveal a fake. The logo should appear to made of high-quality metal construction. The circles at the end of the crown's points should have raised bumps. The outline of the crown should glimmer with a different metallic sheen than the inside. If your crown logo looks cheap or flat under magnification, this is a sign of poor craftsmanship (and a likely indicator of a fake). Look for perfectly precise lettering on the dial. Rolexes are renowned for their perfection. Even small, relatively undetectable defects can be clues that your Rolex isn't top quality. Examine the lettering on your watch's dial with a magnifying glass or jeweler's lens. Each letter should be perfectly, precisely formed with straight lines and smooth curves. The spaces between words and letters should be consistent. If you notice that any letters seem to be even slightly uneven or smudged under magnification, this is a sign that the watch was made with sub-optimal printing technology and is probably not a Rolex. It's also worth mentioning that, obviously, any sort of misspelling is also a dead giveaway that the watch is a fake. Beware sub-par packaging. Everything about a Rolex watch should be elegant, dignified, and perfect. This even includes the packaging. Real Rolexes come in fine jewelry boxes which usually include a mount to hold and display the watch as well as a small cloth to clean and polish it. All packaging should bear the official Rolex name and logo. The watch should also come with a manual and warranty paperwork. If your watch is missing any of these things, it may not be genuine. Buying a watch by itself off the street is a complete crap shoot — since there's no packaging, there's no way to tell it's authentic. Beware shady locations. When shopping for Rolexes, use common sense. A reputable jeweler or a fine watch dealer is much, much more likely to be selling genuine Rolexes than a street vendor. Rolexes can cost thousands of dollars, so it's safe to assume that anyone who sells them will have the resources to own a legitimate business. If you're unsure whether a certain retailer is a reputable Rolex seller, consult Rolex's online listing of certified retailers here. Pawn shops can be a mixed bag — they may have genuine Rolexes, but they may not, depending on the individuals who sold the shop the watches. Some pawn shops take efforts to ensure that they only sell genuine watches, while others may turn a blind eye to counterfeits. If you don't know whether a certain pawn shop can be trusted, try to find online reviews and testimonials for the store before making your purchase. Beware unusually cheap prices. When it comes to buying Rolexes, if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Rolex watches are fine-made luxury goods crafted to perfection — they're never cheap. The most expensive Rolex watches in the world sell for over a million dollars, while even some of the cheapest models can sell for over $4000. If you're being offered a Rolex for $100 dollars, it doesn't matter what the seller's explanation is — there's either something wrong with the watch or it's not the real thing. Don't accept an unscrupulous seller's excuses. If you're being told that a Rolex watch is being sold for cheap because the seller found it or because it was given as a gift, walk away. Assume that there are no lucky coincidences when spending the kind of money that it takes to purchase a Rolex. When all else fails, take your watch to an experienced jeweler. Sometimes, even when you know what to look for, it's almost impossible to tell whether a watch is the real deal or a fake. In these cases, a knowledgeable, trustworthy jeweler or watch salesman can help you by examining the watch for qualities that the ordinary person can't catch. If you have a great relationship with this expert, you may be able to have your watch's genuineness judged for free. Otherwise, jewelry appraisal services, while not cheap, are fairly affordable when compared to the price of a Rolex. For instance, some jewelry appraisal services can run at a cost of up to $180 per hour. Because of this, you may want to have multiple items appraised at once to get the greatest possible value. Only use jewelry appraisal services that charge by the hour, on a per-piece basis, or for a contracted amount based on the estimated time needed. Never use appraisers that charge a percentage of the jewelry's value — this is a scamming technique. Finished.  ","Response:

train_2,How to Ship a Bicycle Cheaply,"Use an Allen key to unscrew the handlebars from the bike. Put the Allen key into the screw on the front of your handlebars. Turn the wrench counterclockwise to loosen the screw. Once it's loose, you should be able to lift your handlebars from their housing. Place the screws and bolts in a zip lock bag to keep the smaller parts together for when you want to reassemble the bike later. Remove the pedals. Depending on what kind of pedals you have, you'll need either an Allen key or a 15mm wrench. Press down on the pedal with your foot and hold the brake to prevent your bike and pedals from moving. Bend down and insert the Allen key or use the wrench to loosen the bolt on the opposite side of the pedal. Continue to unscrew the bolt until the pedal comes off. You may need a friend to help you hold the bike in place while you unscrew the pedals. Remove the front wheel. If you have a quick-release wheel, all you'll need to do is undo the latch on the front of the wheel and turn the latch counterclockwise to loosen the wheel. If your wheel is secured with a bolt, you'll need a 15mm wrench to remove it. Loosen the bolt on the center of the wheel by turning the wrench counter-clockwise. You may have to loosen the brakes to remove the wheel. Unscrew and take off your seat. Find the bolts that are holding your seat to the frame of the bike and remove them with an Allen key. These bolts will be somewhere under the seat. Some bikes will have two bolts that you need to undo while others will just have one. Turn the key counterclockwise to loosen the bolt until the seat comes off. Your bike should now be mostly unassembled and ready for transport. Let the air out of your tires by pressing the needle on the nozzle. Deflate your tires to make more room in your shipping container for the rest of the bike. Doing this will also prevent the tubes from popping while you're shipping it. Unscrew the caps on your bike's tires and softly press down on the needle in the center of the valve to release the air from the tires. Don't squeeze your tires before you depress the needle or you may damage them. Get a cardboard bike box at a bike shop. Find a box made for the same style of bike that you have. See if you can try to get the box for free. If the bike shop doesn't have any boxes, you can purchase one online for a low fee. Purchase a bike travel case for more expensive bikes. Bike travel cases are more expensive than a cardboard box but provide additional protection for your bike. If you are shipping a more expensive bike, consider using a travel case. This may save you money in the long run because you won't have to pay for costly bike repairs. Purchase and cut plumbing insulation to the size of your frame. Purchase pipe insulation online or at a hardware store. This foam material can wrap around the frame of your bike and prevent it from getting damaged during transport. Measure the length on the different parts of your bike's frame and cut the foam insulation to the same size. If you're trying to save even more money, you can use bubble wrap instead of plumbing insulation. Tape or tie the insulation around your bike frame. Wrap the insulation around the frame of your bike and wrap duct tape or zip ties around the insulation and frame. This will secure the foam insulation to your bike's frame and hold it in place. Wrap loose parts with bubble wrap. Take your wheel, handlebars, and pedals and wrap them with bubble wrap. Secure the wrap with tape and set them aside. You should also cover any remaining exposed parts of your bike with whatever bubble wrap you have left over. Place the frame of the bike into the container first. Place the bike's frame and back wheel into the top of the container. Double check to make sure that your bike box is large enough to accommodate the bike's size. If you have a heavy bike, you may need someone to help hold the box in place as you put the frame in it. Place the rest of the parts into the container. Carefully place the rest of the parts into the container, sliding them up as close to the frame as possible. Once you position all of the parts, close the box and make sure that the sides are not bulging. If the sides are bulging, see if you can rearrange the parts in the box so that it doesn't. If the frame is causing the sides of the box to bulge, you'll need a larger box. Tape the box closed. Close all the flaps on the box and apply several coats of tape over the flaps. Once you feel like the box is secure, you're done packing away your bike. Decide which shipping company you want to use. Compare the prices from different shipping companies so that you can find the cheapest option. Major shipping companies like FedEx, USPS, and UPS can ship your bike for a fee. There are also other services like Bikeflights, Sports Express, and Shipbikes.com that specifically ship bicycles. Measure the dimensions of your bike and determine how much each service would cost. Print out a shipping label. You can usually calculate the cost and print and pay for shipping online. Go to the website for the shipping company that you're going to use and fill out the order information. Tape your shipping label to the box securely. Make sure to go over the front of the label with a clear masking tape so that the label won't get damaged in transit. If you can't print the label online, you'll have to visit a shipping facility. Have the bike's destination on hand when filling out the shipping label. Some companies won't ship your box unless all over the edges of the shipping label are securely taped to the box. Take your bike to a shipping facility and pay the fee to send it. Take your package and bring it to the closest shipping facility. If you weren't able to get a label online, you can now get one at the facility. They will weigh and measure the package for you and then tell you how much it will cost. Shipping a bike that weighs 50 pounds (23 kg) can cost anywhere from $100-$400. Keep your shipping container as small as possible. Some shipping companies will charge you based on the size of your box, not the weight of your bike. If your shipping company is charging by box size, choose the smallest box you can find. Use basic shipping. Most of the time shipping companies will have a slower ground option that you can choose. Choosing this option will usually take longer but will cost you less. Take your bike on an airline flight. Check the regulations and fees associated with traveling with your bike. Some airlines offer to transport your bike in the plane. This prevents the likelihood the bike will get lost and can sometimes cost less than shipping it. Consider insuring your bike if it's expensive. While the price of insurance will raise your overall cost, it will prevent you from having to buy a new one if it's lost in transit. This is especially useful if you're shipping the bike internationally. ","Response - The WikiHow article provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to packing and shipping a bicycle.

train_3,How to Seal Pavers,"Choose a water-based sealer if your pavers are laid with joint sand. Water-based sealers are sprayed on and give an even coverage. The main benefit of a water-based sealer is that it hardens the joint sand and penetrates into pavers better. This ends up creating a hard seal over the entire paved area. Water-based sealers do not darken the stones or give a high amount of shine to the pavers. Choose this sealer for bricks that are porous and won't shine much anyway. If you are unsure what type of pavers you have or you aren't sure which sealer is best, consult a home improvement store employee. Water-based sealers often require that you apply more than one coat to the paved area. Buy a solvent sealer to darken stones and make them shine. Solvent sealers can give a much higher gloss to the stones than water-based sealers. The downside is that they do not harden sand as effectively. This sealer is great for smooth, non-porous stones. If your pavers are laid tightly together without joint sand, this is a good option. Solvent sealers are often thicker than water-based sealers, so you may be required to use a roller rather than a sprayer. Read the instructions for proper application. Sealers may be sprayed on with a pump sprayer, laid with a nap roller, or a combination of both. Follow the instructions on the sealer you buy to use the proper tools. Thin sealers can often be sprayed on, which is much faster. Thicker sealers may need to be rolled, which can be slower and won't always cover as evenly. Some sealers are sprayed on but require that you backroll the pavers to even out the coating. Use a sprayer with an adjustable nozzle head. For best application, you want a nice wide fan spray, so be sure that the sprayer you use has either multiple head attachments or an adjustable spray pattern. Never use a sprayer that shoots a narrow stream. A bug sprayer is a good option for this. They are widely available at hardware stores, and they are often inexpensive. Use a roller of appropriate thickness. Many sealers will require that you lay them with a roller rather than a sprayer, and in this case it is important that the roller is thick enough. The sealer will most likely give you instructions about this. For example, one sealer might suggest a roller with a 1” thick nap. This is important because if the roller is not thick enough, the sealer will not get down into the cracks between the pavers and thus won't seal as well as it should. A roller that is too thick might coat the sealer on too thickly as well, and you won't get an even coat across the pavers. Wash the pavers. Sealing without cleaning first is only going to seal dirt and grime into the pavers. You can power wash the pavers, as long as there isn't sand in between that would be washed away. You could use some dish soap and hot water for areas that have oil or tire marks from cars. A stiff broom will help scrub the pavers clean. Let the pavers dry for at least 24 hours before you continue. The type of pavers and the way they are laid will determine the best washing method. If the pavers are packed tightly together, power washing is a great option, but not if the pavers are laid with sand between them. It's rarely a good idea to sand-blast pavers. If the pavers make up a driveway that has a lot of car traffic, wash the pavers more thoroughly to get as much of the grime off as you can. Smooth pavers that don't retain much grime might be sufficiently cleaned with a quick broom sweeping. Level crooked pavers. Sometimes pavers settle unevenly, which creates a tripping hazard in areas that people frequently walk. Lift any uneven pavers and level the spot where they're sitting by adding or removing sand under the paver. If your pavers are laid tightly together, lifting any of them up to even them out may not be an option. Still, sealing is more effective when the pavers are all level. Seal the pavers one section at a time. To make sure you cover the whole paver area, work in a specific pattern. A good option can be going around the entire outer edge of the area first to establish a border, then dividing the rest of the area into 3-5 sections depending on how big it is. For example, a 100 square foot patio could be done in four 5ftx5ft sections. Start at a corner farthest away from your exit, and work your way out towards the exit. This will keep you from walking across the sealant at the end. Move the sprayer nozzle in a circular motion. The sealer will make stones appear darker when they get wet, but it can still be helpful to use a consistent motion. You can move the spraying nozzle in circles for the best coverage. You don't want to cover some areas with more sealer than others, so it is important to pay attention to what stones you cover as you spray. Try not to use too much sealer, as it will take longer to dry. A light layer is all you need. If you are working in a small area, you may not have a hard time keeping track of what you have sealed, but if you are doing an entire driveway it becomes more important. Finish the whole job at once. Sealing pavers is not the kind of thing you want to break up into multiple rounds of work. If you don't do the whole thing at one time, it's likely that you will lose track of where you have already sealed. The amount of time it takes you to seal the entire area will depend on how big it is. A small patio may only take 20 minutes, but an entire driveway will likely take you a couple of hours. Clean the sprayer or roller. Rinse the sprayer or roller thoroughly immediately after you finish the project. If you let the sealer sit for too long it will harden on your equipment. If you don't want to wash the roller, you can throw it away. Make sure to spray water through the nozzle until the water runs clear to clean the hose as well. When you read the sealer instructions, see if there are any special instructions about cleaning equipment. You may need lacquer thinner or something stronger than water to clean the sealer out of your sprayer. ","Response - 
The WikiHow article provides a comprehensive guide to sealing pavers, focusing on two primary types of sealers: water-based and solvent-based. Water-based sealers are ideal for pavers with joint sand, as they penetrate the pavers, harden the sand, and provide an even coverage without significantly darkening or adding shine to the stones. These sealers typically require multiple coats and are best for porous bricks. In contrast, solvent sealers are recommended for smooth, non-porous stones, offering a higher gloss and darker appearance, though they are less effective at hardening joint sand. The sealing process involves several crucial steps: first, thoroughly cleaning the pavers using power washing, dish soap, or a stiff broom, and allowing them to dry completely for at least 24 hours; leveling any uneven pavers to prevent tripping hazards; and then applying the sealer systematically by working in sections, starting from the farthest corner and moving towards the exit. The application can be done using a pump sprayer with an adjustable nozzle or a roller, depending on the sealer's thickness, and requires a consistent circular motion to ensure even coverage. It's important to apply a light layer and complete the entire job in one session to maintain uniformity. After sealing, clean the application equipment immediately to prevent hardening of the sealer. For those unsure about the best sealer or application method, consulting a home improvement store employee is recommended.","Response -

train_4,How to Handle an Emergency Situation,"Remain calm. Although emergencies require rapid action, the most important factor in effectively handling the situation is to keep calm. If you find yourself becoming confused or anxious, stop what you're doing. Take a deep breath. Remember that to be calm in a stressful situation you must deliberately adjust your behavior. Reassure yourself that you can handle the situation. The reason you feel panicked in an emergency is the result of your body's automatic overproduction of the stress hormone cortisol. The cortisol goes to the brain and slows down the pre-frontal cortex, which is the region responsible for planning complex action. By overriding your body's reaction, you can continue to access your critical thinking faculties. You won't be responding from emotion, but from rational thought. Look around and assess the situation to see what needs to be done before acting. Seek additional help. In the USA, call 911 for emergency assistance. Use whatever number is applicable to call emergency services outside the U.S. This phone number will reach an emergency dispatcher who will need to know your location and the nature of the emergency. Answer all of the questions the dispatcher asks. The job of the dispatcher is to provide quick, appropriate emergency response. She can only do this by asking these questions. If you're calling on a traditional telephone or a GPS-equipped cell phone, emergency services may be able to track your location even if you're unable to speak. Even if you can't talk, call emergency services and someone will be able to find you to provide help. It may be a good idea to go over how you would communicate during an emergency , especially if you have a reason to expect an emergency might arise. Determine the nature of the emergency. What signs indicate that there is an emergency? Is this a medical emergency, or is there a threat to the property/building that may result in human injury? It's important to stop and take inventory of the situation calmly before reacting to the emergency. An injury due to motor vehicle accident, or smoke inhalation or burns from a fire are examples of medical emergency situations. A medical emergency consists of sudden physical symptoms, such as intense bleeding, head trauma, loss of consciousness, chest pain, choking, sudden dizziness or weakness. Intense desire to hurt yourself or someone else constitute a mental health emergency. Other mental health changes may also be considered an emergency, such as sudden changes in behavior or experiencing confusion, can be an emergency if they occur without cause. Behavioral emergencies are best met by remaining calm, watching from a short distance, and encouraging the person in crisis to stay calm as well. This way you can react appropriately if the situation becomes volatile. Know that sudden changes can be emergencies. Chemical spills, fires, breaking water pipes, electrical outages, natural disasters such as floods or fires are all examples of potential workplace emergencies. If you have advance warning of the possibility of an emergency, such the warning of flood, heavy snow, tornado, etc., you may be better prepared. However, the nature of an emergency is to be unexpected. When assessing emergency situations, be aware that the situation may be volatile. It may change rapidly. If you have advance warning of an emergency, prepare ahead of time for the best results. Be alert for human-caused emergencies. Assaults or threats of violence at a workplace or home are emergencies that call for rapid response. In most cases, there is no predictable pattern or method to these emergencies. These situations tend to be unpredictable, and they change quickly. If you find yourself in an emergency of this nature, keep yourself safe. Run to a safe location, or find shelter in place. Do not fight, except as a last resort. Being attentive to warning signs in your workplace, including any act of physical violence (pushing, shoving, etc.) should be immediately. Your office should have a procedure for workplace violence, including a phone number you can call to report the situation. If you don't know your office's procedures, ask your supervisor or a trusted coworker. Open, honest communication between employees and supervisors is part of maintaining a safe, healthy workplace. Assess the immediate threat. For example, if one person appears injured, are you or anyone else in danger of also being injured? For example, if one person is caught in a machine, is the machine turned off? If there has been a chemical spill, is the spill spreading towards anyone else? Is the person caught in structure that's collapsing? If the threat isn't contained, this will affect your response. Be aware that any emergency situation may change abruptly, so that ongoing assessment is required. Remove yourself from danger. If you, or others, are at risk of being harmed, leave the situation immediately. If you have an evacuation plan, follow it. Go to an area where you will be safe. In a situation where you cannot leave, find the safest possible location within your given area. For example, hiding beneath a solid surface, such as a desk or table, may help if there is a chance of being hit by falling debris. If you're near a car accident, make sure you're not in the line of oncoming traffic. Get off the road. Be aware that in an emergency, elements are likely to change quickly. In your assessment, notice if volatile or combustible elements are present. For example, in an auto accident, gasoline may catch fire abruptly. Help others leave a hazardous area. If you can safely assist someone else in leaving a dangerous situation, do so. If returning to the emergency situation is risky, a trained rescue person may be better equipped to retrieve anyone in harm's way. Offering verbal reassurance to an injured person if he is conscious will help another person, even if you can't move them. Let that person know who you are and what is happening to them. Ask them questions to keep them conscious. If the emergency is stable, stay with the victim. Determine if you can do anything to help. The most important thing you can do is to remain calm, and stay in control of the situation. Sometimes there is nothing that you can do, and that's fine. Don't be worried about admitting that there's nothing you can do to help. If there are others on the scene who may be upset or fearful, reassure them. Employ them in going to get help. It's better to remain with someone in a supportive way than to do an action that may result in additional damage. If you're not sure what to do, simply stay with the person. If possible, take their pulse, make notes of events as they happen, and ask them about their medical history. This is information you may need when talking to the emergency team. Take time to think before acting. Being in an emergency situation can result in panicked thinking and actions. Instead of reacting to a situation, take time to calm down. Breathe deeply before you take any action. Things change suddenly in emergency situations. Don't panic if things suddenly go in a different direction than you'd expected. Take time to pause whenever you're overwhelmed, panicky or confused. If you need to stop in the middle of taking an action to calm down, that's okay. Get the first aid kit. A first aid kit should have constructive tools for taking care of many medical emergencies. Any first aid kit should contain bandages, gauze, adhesive tape, disinfectant, and other useful items. If you can't retrieve the first aid kit, consider what other items in your immediate vicinity might be good substitutes. You should keep a first aid kit at your home, and your workplace is required by law to maintain a first aid kit. A good first aid kit should also have a ""space blanket"" which is a light-weight piece of special material meant to conserve body heat. This is a vital piece of equipment for people who are chilled or shaking, as it can help keep them from going into shock. Ask basic questions of the injured person. It's important to discern the mental state of the victim in order to better understand the person's injuries. If the person appears confused by the question, or provides the wrong answer, this may suggest additional injuries. If you're not sure if the victim is unconscious, touch their shoulder. Shout or ask loudly, ""Are you okay?"" Questions you should ask include: What is your name? What is the date? How old are you? If they do not respond to questions, you can try rubbing their chest or pinching their earlobe to keep them conscious. You can also gently touch the eyelids to see if they will open. Once you've determined the basic mental status of the person, check with them about any medical complications. Ask them if they have a medical alert bracelet or another medical ID. Avoid moving an injured person. If someone has a neck injury, moving him could result in injuring the spine. Always call emergency services if someone has an neck injury and is unable to move himself. If the person can't walk because of leg or foot injuries, you can help move them by holding them at the shoulders. If the person is afraid to leave a dangerous situation, respond with reassurance. Use the telephone only to ask for help. Your full attention should be on the present situation, and talking on the phone is distracting. In addition, if you are on an older model telephone, the emergency dispatcher may be trying to reach you. Stay off the phone unless you're calling to ask for help. If you're not sure if you're in a true emergency, call emergency services and the dispatcher can help you figure out if emergency officials should be sent. Don't try to document the emergency unless you are sure you are out of danger. Taking ""selfies"" or posting about your situation on social media in ongoing emergency situations may result in additional injury and legal complications. Have an emergency plan. The best response in an emergency situation is to follow the emergency plan of your home or workplace. Certain people may be identified as emergency leaders, with special training. In an emergency, you will save necessary time and energy by following the plan and your designated leader, even if you don't fully agree with them. Your emergency plan should have an assembly place to gather once you've evacuated the home or building. Keep emergency phone numbers posted near the phone. Important medical data should be stored in your phone or your wallet. Know your physical address. You'll need to know your location in order to tell any emergency dispatcher where to send help. While it may be easy to know the address of your home, it's also important to memorize the address of your workplace. Get into the habit of checking the address wherever you are. If you don't know the physical address, be ready to say the name of the street you're on and any nearby intersections or landmarks. If your cell phone has GPS, you can use it to determine your physical address. However, this wastes much needed time in an emergency. Identify your closest exits. Always be aware of the exits to any building you're in, whether they're home, office, or commercial locations. Identify at least 2 exits, in case one is blocked. In a workplace or public location, exits should be clearly marked. Choose two places where you can regather with your family or coworkers. One location should be outside the home or workplace. The other location should be outside the immediate vicinity, in case the neighborhood is unsafe. Emergency exits should be physically accessible, according to ADA laws. Take a first aid course. Having a first aid kit isn't helpful unless you have training to use it. Having training to properly apply bandages, compresses, tourniquets and other tools will help in an emergency. The Red Cross regularly offers these courses in most areas of the US. Many Red Cross courses are also offered online. First aid courses can be age specific. If you have children, or just want to know how to help children in case of an emergency, take a first aid course specific to assisting children in an emergency. If you work with children, you'll be required by law to receive this training. Consider taking CPR in addition to first aid. Having CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) training is a life-saving help for someone having a heart attack. If you haven't taken a CPR course, you can still offer chest compressions for someone suspected of having a heart attack. A chest compression is hard pressure applied swiftly to the ribcage at the rate of 100 compressions per minute, or just over 1 per second. CPR for children and infants is taught by the Red Cross. If you have children, take a course in providing CPR for children in order to be prepared in case of an emergency. If you work with children, you may be required by law to receive this training. Know what chemicals are found in your home or workplace. If the emergency occurs in your workplace, you should know where to find the MSDS (Material Data Safety Sheet) for any chemical used. Having a list of the chemicals used in your home or workplace, together with any first aid measures required in case of emergency, will be the most effective way you can prepare for emergency situations. Your workplace should have an eyewash station if you regularly come into contact with hazardous chemicals. Make sure you are prepared to share any relevant information regarding chemicals with your emergency response team. Keep emergency phone numbers posted near the phone. Post the number for 911 as well as other important medical phone numbers, including the phone numbers of family members who should be contacted. The phone number of the poison control center, ambulance center, your doctors' phone numbers should be posted alongside contact numbers of neighbors or nearby friends or relatives, and work phone numbers. All members of your house, including your children, should be able to access these phone numbers in case of an emergency. For children, elderly people, or disabled people, consider having a posted script to help them remember what to tell others when calling on the phone with an emergency situation. You can even role play with them to go over the script and teach them proper actions for different emergency situations. Wear a medical ID tag if you have a chronic health condition. If you have a condition that a medical response team should be aware of, such as diabetes, certain allergies, epilepsy or other seizure disorder, or other medical conditions, a medical ID tag can provide this information should you be unable to. Most medical responders look on a person's wrist for medical ID tags. The second most common place to look is at the person's neck, as a necklace. People with disabilities and health conditions, such as Tourette syndrome, autism, dementia, etc., may wish to consider wearing medical ID badges to help any emergency responder better understand their needs and behavior.

train_5,How to Avoid Self Sabotage when You Feel Unloved,"Resist the temptation to self-medicate. When you feel emotional pain such as rejection from a loved one, you may be drawn to practices that allow you to numb your feelings. Feeling unloved can create both anxiety and depression, and you may try to treat these uncomfortable feelings on your own by using alcohol and drugs. Self-medication with substances may help you escape painful emotions in the short-term, but doing so can escalate into addiction, causing an even greater problem in the long-term. Some people may also self-medicate with other practices, such as binge-eating on comfort foods, shopping excessively, or having sex with various people to numb undesirable emotions. If you notice yourself engaging in unsafe or unhealthy behaviors, reach out to a friend or a professional counselor for support. Spend time with positive influences. There's a saying that you are the sum of the five people closest to you. If those near and dear to you engage in unhealthy, self-destructive behaviors like using alcohol or drugs, engaging in risky sex, or gambling, you are more prone to do the same. Carefully choosing your social group can make all the difference in the type of behaviors you do regularly. Make the choice to remove negative influences from your life. Highlight those relationships that influence you to make positive decisions like going to work or school, setting goals, and treating your body well. If you don't have any positive influences, open yourself up to making new friends. If you find that some people around you are negative influences, tell them, ""I'm sorry, but we're going to have to stop spending time together. I have been making unhealthy choices and I need to reevaluate many of my relationships."" Find creative outlets for pain. Rather than turning to self-sabotaging behaviors, use your emotional pain for good by getting creative. Exercising your inner creativity can help you channel negative feelings like rejection, disappointment, or hatred into positive activities like writing, painting, music, drama or any other art form. Being creative can help you heal from feeling unloved and decrease feelings of stress or anxiety. Use your emotional pain as a stimulus to draw a picture or write a song. Get out a fresh piece of paper and write a story. Or, you can turn on some soothing music and dance out what you are feeling inside. Challenge negative thought patterns. Sometimes the script running through your head all day can contribute to your mood. If you are thinking negative thoughts like “Nobody cares about me” or “I will be alone forever,” then your self-talk is steering you down a dark and depressed path. How you interpret situations and the world around you can make a big difference on how you feel. Learn to identify and challenge negative thoughts in order to stop self-sabotaging behaviors. If you notice yourself feeling particularly low or blue, try to think back to what you have been telling yourself in your head. Your thoughts are probably negative. For example, if you say “Nobody cares about me” because none of your friends or family called you, you can challenge the evidence surrounding this thought. Perform reality testing by asking yourself if your thoughts are facts or just your own interpretations. If you can think of one person who does seem to care for you, then you automatically cancel out the validity of the statement. Reframe negative thoughts to make them more positive and realistic. You might say, “Sometimes, I feel like nobody cares for me. Maybe if I called my loved ones instead of waiting on them to call, I wouldn't feel like this.” Ask for support when you need it. Often we might complain that no one seems to be there for us, but we don't actually make requests of loved ones. If you are guilty of wishing friends or family would reach out to you, but never taking the initiative, it's time to change that. Don't expect others to read your mind. If you want company, ask for it. If you need a hug, tell someone. You can simply say to a friend, “Jessica, I've been feeling very lonely and unloved lately. Can we make plans together this weekend to hang out? I could use some company?” Look for shared similarities. If you are always pointing out the differences between yourself and others, then you are making it hard to belong. When you stop paying attention to differences and focus on common ground, you will find more people with whom you can potentially connect. Find your tribe by challenging yourself to get out more. Join a book club based on your favorite genre. Participate in a local Meetup of singles in your age group. Take a Pilates class at your community gym. When you enter these social situations look for similarities between you and others. Then, point them out to start conversations. You might say, “Ooh, I love your gym bag! It matches my leggings! Where'd you get it?” Aim for greater empathy. Empathy is basically the ability to experience what another person is experiencing, or walking in their shoes. When you are able to adequately understand the feelings and perspectives of others, you will feel more connected to the larger whole of humanity. Instead of simply focusing on feeling unloved, strive to show more love and compassion to others through empathy. Start by improving your listening skills. Too frequently, we listen to reply rather than understand. When you are engaged in a conversation, orient towards the other person and make occasional eye contact. Eliminate distractions and fully focus on the other person's message. Try to imagine what they must be feeling based on their words. Mirror their emotional state by saying “Hmmm” or “Aww” as is appropriate. Then, summarize what you heard by saying “It sounds like you had a really rough time…” After attending to their emotions and clarifying that you received the intended message, you may share your own response. Volunteer. There is no better way to feel a part of the bigger picture than when you are lending a helping hand to those in need. In addition to allowing you to gain a sense of belonging, volunteering also gives you the chance to make a difference in your community. Community service also lifts your mood, helps you forge connections with others, and helps you spend your time in a meaningful way. Overcome your feelings of rejection and being unloved by spreading love to others. Sign up at a local civic center, church, nursing home, or school to help those in need. Identify your personal strengths. Cultivate a positive self-worth by figuring out your best qualities. Your personal strengths are the abilities, talents, and skills you have that make you an asset to the world around you. When you know what your strengths are you have a higher self-esteem and you feel more capable of managing life's problems. Make a list of personal strengths that you think may be used to describe you. These may include “loyal,” “intelligent,” or “compassionate.” If you have trouble coming up with ideas, ask a parent, teacher or close friend to give you some suggestions of strengths they see you demonstrate on a daily basis. You might also take a survey such as the VIA Character Strengths survey. Are you creative? Curious? Loving? Humble? A quiz or survey can inspire you. Create objective goals and work towards them. Goal attainment is another route to developing a stronger sense of self-worth. When you feel like you are moving towards something meaningful in your future, you are less likely to sabotage your progress with destructive habits. Plus, accomplishing goals creates a domino effect that will improve your mood and relationships, too. Set S.M.A.R.T. goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. For example, if you plan to learn a new language, you might say “I want to learn to speak intermediate Spanish within the next 6 months.” Then, you will devise a plan to reach that goal like listening to Spanish tapes, taking a course, and interacting with native Spanish-speakers. Promote your passions. Doing what you love can go a long way towards encouraging self-worthiness and a brighter mood overall. Think about activities you enjoy and build your days and weeks around doing them. Over time, you will notice that you are starting to live a more purposeful, happier life. Do you like building things? Start a new DIY project to build a piece of furniture for your home. Other hobbies may include writing, archery, gardening, bowling, or graphic design. A hobby can be virtually anything, and you can increase your love of the activity by joining a group of others who do it, too. This creates a sense of belonging and worthiness to help improve your outlook on life. Trying something new can also be helpful. Take up a brand new hobby or activity – this will get your creative juices flowing, challenge you, and teach you some new things. You may be surprised at what you learn. Nurture your body with a proper diet and exercise. You can enhance your self-worth through self-care. Of course, you already know that you should be consuming a balanced diet and getting regular physical activity. But, you may not know how these factors play into your perception of yourself and the world around you. When you nourish your body with healthy foods and stay active, you will feel more positive about your life and your relationships. When you feel bad about yourself, you may eat unhealthy foods and skip the gym. Show support for your body by eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. Drink lots of water throughout the day. Go for a walk around your local park. Throw a ball to your dog. Or, ask a friend to join you on a cycling adventure. See a therapist. A professional mental health therapist can help you identify the source of your negative emotions and develop healthy skills to lead a more satisfying life. Your self-worth may have been jeopardized by unhealthy relationships or abuse from your past. Talking about these experiences in a unbiased and supportive context can lead to healing. One recognized form of therapy for those who self-sabotage is dialectical behavior therapy. This treatment approach is directed at gaining a better understanding of your feelings in order to build skills that help you stop problematic behaviors. You may work with your therapist to prevent overeating, stop risky sexual activities, and establish healthy relational patterns. Another is cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT will help you identify beliefs that fuel your self-worth. Once you identify those beliefs, you can explore their origins and validity and eventually replace them with thoughts and beliefs that are true. Determine if you require medication for depression. Self-sabotage is prominent in people who feel depressed but do not know how to express or improve their emotions. If feeling unloved has led to depressive symptoms, you need to see a doctor. Depression may manifest as a loss of interest in once pleasurable activities, withdrawing from loved ones, having trouble eating or sleeping, and feeling hopeless. A certain class of prescribed medications known as antidepressants are effective at improve depressive symptoms. This may be advisable if therapy alone does not improve your symptoms. Take part in a support group. Support is imperative for anyone struggling with mental illness. It's vital to build a network of health care providers and loved one who are there for you as you heal. However, meeting with other people who have gone through what you are going through can also be comforting. Ask your mental health provider about support groups for people who are struggling with the same issues as you. Attending these groups can help you learn how others cope with feeling unloved and help you gain a sense of belonging in a supportive group.

train_6,How to Make Flavored Water,"Make citrus water. Wash 1–3 citrus fruits per quart (liter). Slice into thin rounds and leave in cold water for at least three hours. If you plan to leave it in longer for more intense flavor, cut off the rinds first to avoid bitter flavors. See below for a step-by-step guide covering all fruit and herb recipes. Try adding ¼ cup (60mL) mint or basil leaves. Flavor with strawberries or raspberries. Use about 1 cup (240mL) fruit per quart (liter) water. Fresh berries won't infuse well until they're crushed with a wooden spoon. Frozen berries are already broken, but you may crush further to speed things up. Infuse for three hours or more, then strain. This combines well with the juice of half a lemon. Create a cucumber concoction. Slice a cucumber into thin rounds and add to a pitcher of water. Let steep overnight, then drink within a day or two. Optionally, cut the whole cucumber in half lengthwise and scoop out the pulp before slicing. Enhance this mild flavor with three or four slices of lemon or cubes of pineapple. Mix blackberry and sage. This sophisticated combination is subtle but delicious. Try 1 cup (240mL) blackberries per quart (liter), plus a handful of sage leaves. Infuse with apple. Apple and other hard fruits don't seep flavor as quickly as others. Slice very thinly and infuse for up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. An hour before serving, transfer to room temperature for added flavor. Select your fruit. Follow one of the recipes above, or just choose your favorite fruit. You can play around with the amounts, but start with several small fruits per quart (liter), or 1–2 cups (240–480mL) berries or cubed fruit. Fresh fruit in season has the best flavor. Frozen fruit won't look as attractive, but may have more flavor than out-of-season fresh fruit. Wash fruit thoroughly. Rub all fresh fruit thoroughly under cool, running water. Since the peel will be sitting in the water, scrubbing contaminants off the surface is extra important. If the fruit is not organic, consider peeling it to remove pesticides on the surface. This is not necessary for frozen fruit. Slice into wedges or rounds. Rounds will infuse more quickly on their own if they are weighed down underneath ice cubes. Wedges may not add much flavor unless you muddle the fruit as described below. Slice rounds in half for a narrow pitcher. No slicing is necessary for berries or cubed fruit. Add to cold water. Drop your fruit into a pitcher of chilled or room temperature water. If you dislike the taste of your tap water, put it through a filtration device before adding fruit. Hot water will infuse with flavor more quickly, but turns the fruit into mush and may destroy some nutrients. Muddle gently (optional). Crushing the fruit will speed up the infusion significantly, but you may end up with a murky, pulpy mixture. For a more attractive pitcher, squeeze some of the juice out using a wooden spoon handle, pressing and twisting but not pulverizing the fruit completely. Leave the fruit untouched if you can wait a few hours. Alternatively, leave whole slices in for decoration, but squeeze in the juice of one fruit to add more flavor. To flavor a single glass of water for immediate drinking, pulverize the fruit with a muddling stick. Add a handful of herbs (optional). Mint and basil are the most common options, but you can use rosemary, sage, or just about any other herb. Rinse the leaves, then rub them between clean hands to bruise them slightly before adding to the water. You can add dried herbs, but place them in a tea strainer so they don't leave fragments in the drink. Add ice (optional). Besides chilling the water, ice weighs down fruit that floats to the top and filters out some of the fruit pieces while pouring. Wait for infusion. Chill the water in the refrigerator for 3–4 hours, or up to 12 hours for extra-potent flavor. To avoid bacteria and unpleasant flavors, strain out ingredients after 12 hours and drink within three days. Stir before serving. The water will infuse faster at room temperature, but also decompose faster. Steep for 1–2 hours, and drink within 4–5 hours of mixing. Combine with tea. Let your fruit sit in the same pitcher as a tea bag or tea strainer. Keep this at room temperature, so the tea infuses without overpowering the other flavors. Steep for 1–3 hours, remove tea, and drink immediately. Try these recipes, adding each one to a quart (liter) of water: Black tea bag, three mandarin oranges, four basil leaves, black tea bag Two green tea bags, ½ mango (sliced), ¼ cup (60mL) strawberries Infuse with spices. Add a stick of cinnamon, a tablespoon (15mL) fresh grated ginger, and/or ¼ tsp (1 mL) vanilla extract. These work particularly well in tangy recipes. Try the following: ½ cup (120mL) cubed pineapple, ½ sliced orange, 1 tbsp (15mL) grated ginger 1 cup (240mL) blueberries, ¼ tsp (1 mL) vanilla extract Replace regular water with seltzer. Make your own soda replacement with low sugar and no artificial sweeteners. Mix in coconut water. Replace ¼ of your water with coconut water. Try infusing with peaches or honeydew melon. You may use coconut milk instead, but the thicker, richer drink may be more difficult to balance with fruit.

train_7,How to Play Powerball,"Know where (and to whom) Powerball tickets are sold. In 43 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Powerball tickets are available at authorized lottery retailers, which means they are usually found at the same places that most other lottery tickets are - drugstores, gas stations, and grocery stores. The game can be played by anyone over the age of 18. You don't have to be a resident of a Powerball state to play if you purchase your ticket in a Powerball state. You don't even have to be a U.S. citizen to play and win the Powerball. However, if you are not a U.S. citizen and you win a substantial jackpot, the IRS deducts a flat rate of 30% from your winnings. U.S. citizens are subject to different rules. Powerball tickets are not sold in Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada, Utah, Alabama, and Mississippi. These states prohibit lotteries by law. Finally, Powerball tickets cannot be purchased via mail or the internet, except from the website of Powerball's recommended lottery ticket service, which purchases legal tickets on your behalf. Know when drawings occur. Official Powerball drawings occur every Wednesday and Saturday night at 10:59 PM Eastern Time. Powerball ticket sales cut off at least 59 minutes before each drawing, though they may occur earlier. When you buy a Powerball ticket at the store, unless you pay for multiple drawings, it is only valid for the next drawing. In other words, if your Powerball ticket doesn't win, it's not eligible to win in future drawings, unless you specifically pay for multiple drawings. The more drawings that occur without a jackpot winner, the higher the jackpot gets. Jackpots start at a minimum of $40 million and increase each time a drawing occurs without a jackpot winner. Current drawing results are posted to the top of the USA Mega Millions and Powerball website. Most places where Powerball tickets are sold will also post the most recent draws. Understand how Powerball is played. Powerball is played by selecting six numbers - five numbers between 1-69 and one number between 1-26. Each number is on a special ball that is randomly selected by a machine during the drawing. Your ultimate goal is to match every number selected perfectly, which will win you the jackpot. However, there are other winning combinations of numbers that will win smaller prizes (which can be quite lucrative in their own right). Your first five numbers don't have to be in the same order as the balls that are drawn. Winning numbers win regardless of the order they're listed in. However, the final Powerball number must match exactly - none of the first five numbers can count toward it. The number of balls and the odds change regularly. They are current as of January 2016. Know Powerball's prize-winning combinations. If the numbers you picked match the numbers drawn in any one of nine combinations, you can collect your winnings. Note that the prize amounts below represent base values - Power Play prizes are subject to a 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x multiplier, selected at random (except for Jackpots, which aren't multiplied, and prizes for matching five white balls, which will only double). The winning combinations are: Matching only the red ball: $4 winnings Matching the red ball and one white ball: $4 Matching the red ball and two white balls: $7 Matching three white balls: $7 Matching the red ball and three white balls: $100 Matching four white balls: $100 Matching the red ball and four white balls: $10,000 Matching five white balls: $1,000,000 Matching the red ball and five white balls: Jackpot! Note: prizes differ in California because state law requires lottery prizes to be awarded on a pari-mutuel basis. Get a ticket. Single Powerball tickets cost $2 a piece. In every state except California, you also have the option to play “Power Play”. Power Play is an add-on to the ticket price that increases your winnings for all non-jackpot prizes should you win. As of January 2014, prizes for winning tickets with the Power Play add-on are subject to a 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x multiplier, selected at random before each drawing. For instance, a $4 prize would become either $8, $12, $16, or $20 with Power Play. This option costs $1 extra. The Power Play option is unavailable in California because state laws require that lottery prizes be paid on a pari-mutuel basis. This means that lottery prizes can't be set at absolute values, but must fluctuate based on the number of tickets sold and the amount of winning tickets. Fill out your ticket. Though Powerball tickets will vary slightly from state to state, the basic method for filling a ticket out is the same everywhere. On your ticket, you'll need to specify the numbers you want to bet on, the number of drawings you want, and whether or not you want the Power Play option. Follow the guidelines below for filling out a basic ticket: Fill in the spaces for five numbers from 1-69 and one number from 1-26. Usually, Powerball tickets are divided into multiple sections called ""boards"" which have rows of multiple-choice style bubbles to fill in to choose your numbers. Each board essentially counts as one $2 ticket. In other words, for $2, you can fill out one board on the ticket and bet on a single set of numbers. Each subsequent board filled out costs $2 more but allows you to bet on an additional set of numbers. Indicate for each board whether you'd like the ""Power Play"" option. Each board (except in California) should have a space that allows you to buy a Power Play for your set of numbers. For random numbers, fill in the QP space instead of your numbers. ""QP"" stands for ""Quick Pick"" - this lets a computer randomly choose numbers for you. Choose how many drawings you want. Most tickets have a ""Multidraw"" section that allows you to pay for multiple drawings. For instance, if you want to bet on your numbers for two back-to-back drawings, fill in the ""2"" space. Each subsequent drawing costs as much as an additional ticket. If you make an error on any board, fill in the ""VOID"" space for that board. Don't try to erase - instead, mark the board void and fill your numbers in on another board. When you're finished, pay for your ticket. The clerk will calculate the price of your ticket based on how many boards and Power Plays you've selected. For example, if we play 5 draws on one board with a Power Play and 5 without, we would pay 5 × 3 + 5 × 2 = $25. Alternatively, ask the clerk for a Quick Pick ticket. If you don't wish to fill out a lengthy Powerball ticket by hand or you don't care which numbers you bet on, you can usually ask for a Quick Pick ticket instead of the normal Powerball ticket. In this case, a computer will randomly choose your numbers for you as if you had filled in the ""QP"" space for a board on the normal ticket. If you win, collect your winnings. Small prizes can be claimed directly from the vendor you bought the ticket from, while larger prizes require official verification. If your winnings are less than $600, simply go to the lottery retailer with your ticket to claim your winnings. If your winnings are over $600, go to a lottery district office to present your ticket. The precise procedures for claiming large prizes differ from state to state - you may need to fill out a claim form, etc. Powerball tickets do expire. The time window you have to claim a prize differs from state to state - from 90 days to a full year. If you can't make it to the vendor or lottery office for some reason (for instance, if you've left the state you bought the ticket in), it's legal to mail your ticket to the state lottery office. Powerball provides a map that links you to state lottery pages, which will have more specific information about claiming prizes in your state. For jackpot prizes, choose a payout option. Congratulations, you won the jackpot! The only question remaining before you retire is this: how would you like your money? Powerball jackpot winners have two options for receiving their cash - they can receive the entire prize at once in a lump sum , or they can receive it as an annuity - in other words, in yearly installments. Choosing which prize to take is a complicated decision that will differ based on your personal financial situation. Taking the cash as a lump sum will give you lots of money up front, so it may be a good idea if you have a dream purchase or investment you'd like to make immediately. The annuity option invests the cash winnings, gives you your first installment immediately, then gives subsequent payments each year for 30 years (plus interest), which is a better situation for long-term stability. Note that Powerball winnings are subject to federal and/or state income taxes. Because of this, the annuity option will net you more money in the long term - not only will you receive interest on your winnings, but each year you'll only have to pay taxes on about 1/30th of your total prize, meaning more of your prize will be taxed at a lower bracket. On the other hand, with a large lump sum payment, you can expect to pay up to about half of your winnings in taxes, depending on your state's income tax rules. Understand Powerball odds. Like any lottery, Powerball's jackpot odds are very slim. Many avid Powerball players consider the excitement of going against the odds to be part of the fun. To make an educated decision when buying Powerball tickets, consult the official odds listed below, which are for a single random $2 ticket: Matching only the red ball: 1 in 38.32 Matching the red ball and one white ball: 1 in 91.98 Matching the red ball and two white balls: 1 in 701.33 Matching three white balls: 1 in 579.76 Matching the red ball and three white balls: 1 in 14,494.11 Matching four white balls: 1 in 36,525.17 Matching the red ball and four white balls: 1 in 913,129.18 Matching five white balls: 1 in 11,688,053.52 Matching the red ball and five white balls: 1 in 292,201,338.00 Overall odds of winning any prize at all: 1 in 24.87 ","Response - The WikiHow article provides a comprehensive guide to playing Powerball, covering everything from ticket purchasing to prize claiming.

train_8,How to Apply Heat Transfer Vinyl,"Choose and purchase vinyl. There are many colors and patterns to choose from. Look online for vinyl, or visit your local craft store to get a better idea of what the vinyl will truly look like. Consider bringing fabric samples with you, to make sure your vinyl color will be visible. Make sure you purchase a vinyl compatible with the fabric you want to use. Some vinyls are only for cotton, others work best on spandex. Design your own image using computer software. You can use a program like Photoshop or its free alternatives such as Gimp, Seashore, and Pixlr. Choose bold, easy to read fonts when adding letters to your design. Consider how much room you will have on the fabric you are transferring onto. For example, if your design is for a baseball hat, you might want to keep it simple, and not add too much information in it. Choose pre-printed vinyl designs if you don’t have design software. You can purchase vinyl designs online and in stores. Reverse your design. It is very important to remember is to reverse the image, so that it does not come out backwards on your final product. Most software will have an option to “mirror” the image, if not, use edit tools like “flip horizontal” or “flip vertical” to make sure you print your design as a mirror image of what you want. If you're using words, make sure the letters are backwards, for example, “love” should read as “evol” in your design Similarly, make sure individual letters are backwards. Run you're design through according to the instructions of your cutter. If you are using a specialty cutter, remember that with most machines, you will need to feed the vinyl dull-side-up. Print your image directly on the vinyl if you do not have a cutter. You may need to cut the vinyl sheet down to the size of printer paper. Make sure your image prints on the back, the dull side, of your vinyl. Alternatively, print your image on paper and then use artists tape to tape down the paper to the vinyl, and the vinyl to your work surface. Cut out your design by hand if you are not using a cutter. Place your vinyl on a workspace shiny side down. Using an exacto knife, or precision scissors, carefully follow the stencil you have printed out. Take breaks to make sure you are cutting all the way through the first layer, but not cutting through the entire vinyl. You can also use a paper puncher or a die-cut machine to make fast shapes. Peel your vinyl. Carefully peel away the clear layer of the vinyl, making sure not to rip any part of your image. Peel away everything that is not part of your final design. ""Weed"" your design with sharp tools like a pointed needle and exacto knife. Weeding is when you remove small parts of your image's negative space. Use the sharp points of your tools to pick up small areas and peel them off more easily. Heat a clothes iron to the temperature written on your vinyl's packaging. It is also good to prepare your fabric by running your iron over it to get out all wrinkles and moisture. Lay your design onto the fabric, this time shiny side up. It should be positioned how you want it to look in your final product. Press your iron onto your design, hard, for about 15 seconds. Move along to the next section of your design, and press for another 15 seconds, making sure each part of the vinyl gets ironed on!  Do not hastily rub the iron over the vinyl as if you were ironing an item of clothing quickly, you do not want to accidentally wrinkle the vinyl. Peel off the carrier sheet. Read the instructions that came with your vinyl, some require that you peel off the carrier sheet once your project has cooled, others should be peeled off right away. Wash your new item inside out using cold water. Do not wash your item for 24 hours after applying the heat transfer vinyl. Follow the care label of the item, but do not bring it to the dry cleaner, the chemicals used are too harsh. Dry your item with low or no heat, and iron your vinyl item carefully. Again, turn the fabric inside-out, and tumble dry on low heat. Alternatively, you can lay your item flat to dry, or line dry it. Use teflon sheet paper over the vinyl when ironing, or turn the item inside-out, and use low heat on the iron. Fix areas that are peeling off with an iron and teflon paper. If your vinyl is peeling off, iron the peeling parts back on with the same heat setting you used for that vinyl before, placing teflon paper over the vinyl beforehand. Press for 15-20 seconds.

Many art stores now sell pre-made silkscreens as well, so you could purchase a standard screen if you don't want to make a custom one. Ensure that your frame is big enough for your design. If you don't know your design yet, or want a versatile frame for multiple designs, aim for 12x18"" at the minimum. Purchase your mesh. You want a nice, fine mesh that allows the ink to pass onto the shirt, paper, or design. Mesh-count measures how loose or tight the mesh is, where higher numbers indicate a tighter mesh. The tighter the mesh, the more intricate your details can be. Mesh count is the number of threads in one square inch. For the classic ""athletic"" or collegiate print that looks worn/speckled, aim for a loose 85 mesh count. For a ""do-it-all"" mesh, aim for 110-130 mesh count. For paper or plastic printing, go for a mesh count near 200-250. In general, lighter colored objects work best with higher mesh counts. So if you're doing white paper, aim from 230-250. Staple the mesh into the frame. Make sure you pull the screen tight before you start stapling. You want it to be as taut as possible without ripping. Stretch the mesh across the frame and staple around the wood every 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 cm.). You will likely need an electric staple gun to securely adhere the mesh. You can also use framing nails. Create a stencil of your design. Silkscreens can only apply one color at a time, so create a simple shape or outline to begin learning. Whatever you draw will eventually be the inked part of the print. To make your own print, you need: Poster board, thin cardboard, or other thick & sturdy paper. Pencil X-acto knife or another precision knife Know the artistic limitations and challenges of screen-printed designs. Screen printing isn't difficult, as what you draw is exactly what you get on the final print. However, there are certain principles and limitations to screen printing that you should know as you design your print: You can only print 1 color at a time. High contrast images (like black on white) work the best, as you cannot use shading. For complex designs, you need to make multiple prints, one for each color, and layer them after the ink has dried. Sketch your design onto the poster board. Sketch out the blocks of your design. You can upload photos or other images into photo editing software as well and use those. To do so, reduce the drawing to a basic two-tone outline then print it. To make a stencil on Photoshop, for example, you would take a black and white image and click Image → Adjustments → Threshold, then set it up near the highest it can be. Cut the design out as a stencil. Everything that you cut away will be un-inked on the final print, and everything covered by the stencil will be covered in ink. For example, imagine you are printing the red logo of a bulls-eye on a white t-shirt. When you cut out the stencil, all of the rings that you cut away will be white, and all of the rings that are covered by the stencil will be red. Alternatively, draw your design on transparent paper. For complex prints, it can be very difficult to cut out the entire outline. In this case, use thick black ink on transparent paper to make your stencil. Your stencil or drawing needs to block light, as this is what etches the design into the screen and allows you to print. Everything covered by a stencil or black ink will not get exposed to light, leaving it ""open"" and allowing ink to pass onto the shirt or item. Coat your silk screen with a thin layer of photo emulsion. Pour a line of emulsion along a side of the screen and use the squeegee to spread a thin line along the entire screen. Photo emulsion reacts to light, hardening when exposed, so anything not covered by your stencil will turn into a barrier preventing ink from getting through. Apply emulsion to the flat side of the frame, not the side surrounded by wood. Do this in as dark a room as possible to prevent the emulsion from hardening before you're ready. Let the emulsion dry in a dark space. Expose it to as little light as you can. A closet or bathroom will work well, as long as you can close some curtains Set up an ""exposure area"" while waiting for the emulsion to dry. You'll need to expose the emulsion to a direct, strong light to prepare it. Following the specification on the photo emulsion bottle, set up a light above your flat black surface. Each emulsion has different times, watts, and distances needed for proper hardening, so be sure to read the bottle before beginning. The lamp should always be 1-2 feet above the emulsion. If the emulsion calls for 30 minutes at 200 watts, set up a lamp with a 200W bulb 1-2 feet above a table. The screen goes under the light. Place your screen under the light in the exposure area. As you're moving the screen, cover it with a towel so it does not react to incidental light. Place it under the lamp in your station, leaving the towel on for now. Put your stencil backwards on the middle of the screen. The screen should be emulsion side up. The mesh will be lifted a few inches off the table and resting on the frame. Place your stencil in the middle of the screen with 4-5 inches of space between the design and the edge of the frame. You must place your stencil down in reverse to get the right image. Look at your stencil the way you want it, then flip it over before you put it down. Otherwise, you will get a mirror image when you start printing. If there is a breeze, or your stencil is very light, place a clear piece of glass on top of it to keep it from moving. Do not push, prod, or move your screen, light, or stencil once it is placed and set. Turn on the light for the recommended time. Simply follow the instructions on your emulsion bottle and remove the screen when it is done. When it is done, remove the stencil and set it aside for later. If you smell anything burning during this process, turn off the light immediately. If you prepared the emulsion correctly, you should see the faint outline of your stencil in the emulsion when the design is removed. Blast off the emulsion with cold water. Take any high-powered water source (shower, faucet, hose) and wash off the screen, focusing on your image. The water will wash away the unhardened emulsion around your design. You should see the outline of your stencil appear. Keep on spraying until you can see your image well.  Let the screen dry before moving on to the next step. Line up your screen above the object you're printing on. The mesh should be touching whatever you're printing on, like paper or a shirt. If you're using a shirt, slide some cardboard between the layers of the shirt to prevent the ink from bleeding through. Squeegee some ink over your design. Put a thin line of ink just above your design. Then drag the squeegee over your design firmly, coating the entire stencil in ink. The harder you press the darker your image will be. Slowly pull off your silkscreen. Pull the screen off the t-shirt/paper with even pressure, then hang the shirt up to dry. Your design will be printed. Repeat with as many shirts as you want, cleaning the screen occasionally. You can use your silkscreen again with another t-shirt if you want, adding more ink as necessary. Simply wipe down the backside after every shirt and reapply ink. If you're using the same print for multiple days in a row, rinse and dry it at the end of each day. ","Response - Screen printing is a detailed multi-step process for creating custom prints on various surfaces like t-shirts, paper, and other materials. The process begins with selecting and preparing a canvas stretcher frame, choosing an appropriately sized frame (ideally 12x18"" minimum) and purchasing a suitable mesh with the right mesh count for your desired design. The mesh count determines the detail and quality of the print, with different counts recommended for various purposes: 85 for a classic worn look, 110-130 for versatile printing, and 200-250 for paper or plastic printing.

The key steps involve creating a stencil of your design, which can be done using poster board or cardboard, understanding that screen printing allows only one color at a time and works best with high-contrast images. You'll need to coat the silk screen with photo emulsion in a dark room, carefully place your stencil in reverse, and expose it to light according to the emulsion's specifications. After exposure, you'll wash away the unhardened emulsion to reveal your design.

The actual printing involves aligning the screen over your target surface, using a squeegee to apply ink across the stencil. Pressure determines ink density, and you can repeat the process multiple times, cleaning the screen between uses. The technique requires precision, patience, and an understanding of design limitations, but allows for creating custom, unique prints on various surfaces.","Response - Screen printing is a detailed multi-step process for creating custom prints on various surfaces like t-shirts, paper, and other materials.

train_10,How to Make Bioplastic,"Gather the necessary materials. To make this type of bioplastic, you will need cornstarch, distilled water, glycerol, white vinegar, a stove, a saucepan, a silicone spatula, and food coloring (if desired). These items should be readily available at the grocery store or online. Glycerol is also called glycerine, so try searching for that if you're having trouble finding glycerol. The following amounts of each ingredient are needed to make the bioplastic: 10ml distilled water 0.5-1.5g glycerol 1.5g cornstarch 1ml of white vinegar 1-2 drops food coloring Adult supervision is recommended. Combine all of the ingredients and stir together. Add all of the ingredients to the saucepan and stir to combine with the spatula. Stir until you get rid of most of the lumps in the mixture. At this stage, the mixture will be a milky white color and quite watery. If you add the wrong amounts of ingredients, just dispose of the mixture and start again. Heat on medium-low. Place the saucepan on the stove and set the heat to medium-low. Stir continuously as the mixture heats. Bring it to a gentle boil. As the mixture heats, it will become more translucent and begin to thicken. Remove the mixture from the heat when it becomes clear and thick. Total heating time will be around 10-15 minutes. Lumps may begin to form if the mixture gets overheated. Add one-two drops of food coloring at this stage, if you would like to color the plastic. Pour the mixture onto foil or parchment paper. Spread the heated mixture onto a piece of foil or parchment paper to let it cool. If you would like to mold the plastic into a shape, it must be done while it is still warm. See the last method for details on molding the plastic. Remove any bubbles that you see by poking them with a toothpick. Allow the plastic to dry for at least two days. It will take time for the plastic to dry and harden. As it cools, it will begin to dry out. Depending on the thickness of the plastic, it can take longer for it to dry. If you make one small thick piece it will take longer to dry than a thinner larger piece. Leave the plastic in a cool, dry place for this process. Check the plastic after two days to see if it has fully hardened. Gather the necessary materials. To make this type of bioplastic, you will need gelatin or agar powder, glycerol, hot water, a saucepan, a stove, a spatula, and a candy thermometer. These ingredients should be readily available at your local grocery store. Remember, glycerol is also known as glycerine, so look for that if you can't find glycerol. You will need the following amounts of each ingredient: 3g (½ tsp) glycerol 12g (4 tsp) gelatin or agar 60ml (¼ cup) hot water Food coloring (optional) Agar is a substance derived from algae that can be used in place of gelatin to make the bioplastic vegan friendly Stir together all of the ingredients. Combine all of the ingredients in the saucepan and stir until there are no clumps left. You may need to use a whisk to disperse all of the clumps. Place the saucepan on the stove and start heating the mixture on medium-high heat. If you want to color your plastic, you can add a few drops of food coloring at this step. Heat the mixture to 95°C (203°F) or until it begins to froth. Put the candy thermometer into the mixture and monitor the temperature until it reaches approximately 95°C (203°F) or begins to froth. If the mixture begins to froth before it reaches temperature, that is okay. Remove it from the heat when it either reaches temperature or starts frothing. Continue to stir the mixture while it is heating up. Pour the plastic onto a smooth surface covered with foil or parchment paper. After you remove the pan from the heat source, you will need to remove any excessive froth. Spoon it out before pouring the plastic out of the pan. Stir everything to remove all clumps from the plastic. If you just want to make plastic for fun, pour the mixture out onto a smooth surface. Make sure the surface is covered with foil or parchment paper so the plastic can be removed easily. If you want to mold the plastic into a specific shape, you will need to do it during this step. Refer to the last method on molding for more details and help. Leave the plastic to harden for at least two days. The amount of time it will take the plastic to harden is dependent upon how thick the piece is. Generally, it will take at least two days for it to fully dry out and harden. You can make this process go a little faster by using a blow dryer on the plastic. It's easiest to leave the plastic undisturbed for a few days so it can dry on its own. Once the plastic hardens, it can no longer be molded or shaped. If you want to shape it, you must do it while it is still warm and moldable. Make a mold for the plastic. A mold is the negative of a shape that you would like to make. You can make a cast of an object you would like to reproduce by sculpting two pieces of clay around the object. When the clay dries, remove the two pieces. If you fill each half with the liquid plastic and then put the halves together, you can make a copy of that object. You can also use a cookie cutter to cut shapes out of the plastic while it is still warm. An alternative to making your own mold, is to purchase a mold at a craft or hobby shop. Pour the hot plastic into the mold. Once you have a mold, you can use it to make more objects. While the plastic is still hot, pour it into the mold. Make sure that the plastic gets into the entire mold and try pop bubbles by lightly tapping the mold on the counter. To make the object easier to remove when it dries, coat the mold with a non-stick spray before pouring the plastic in. Let the plastic dry for at least two days. The plastic will take a few days to dry and fully harden. The amount of time it takes to dry is dependent upon the thickness of the object. If the object is very thick, it can take longer than two days to fully harden. After two days, check the plastic. If it still appears to be wet, let it sit for another day and check it again. Continue to do this until the plastic is fully dry. Remove your plastic from the mold. After waiting a few days, the plastic will be fully hardened and dry. At this point, you can remove the plastic from the mold. You have now made your own plastic version of whatever object you chose to mold. You can reuse this mold to make as many plastic versions of the object as you like.

train_11,How to Grind Weed Without a Grinder,"Place your marijuana buds into a glass. Fill a clean drinking glass up to half full with weed. You can use either dry or sticky weed. Make sure the weed is loosely packed so you can easily chop it. If you have a lot of weed, chop it in several batches. Insert a clean pair of scissors into the glass. Use a regular pair of scissors to chop the weed. Wash the scissors with soap and warm water or rinse them with vinegar to clean them. Then, place the scissors down into the weed buds and start cutting. If you're using a shot glass, it's okay to use a small pair of scissors like nail scissors or mustache scissors. Snip the buds until they’re in small enough pieces. Simply open and close the scissors to chop up the weed. As you chop, rotate the cup to make it easier to cut all of the weed. Keep cutting until the buds are your desired size. If necessary, stir the weed with the end of your scissors to expose large pieces that still need to be cut. Place the marijuana buds into an empty pill bottle. Wash an old pill bottle with soap and water to clean it. Then, fill the container about 3/4 of the way full. Pack the weed loosely so that the coin can break it up. This works best with dry weed, but it may grind up sticky weed, as well. Drop a clean penny or dime into the bottle. You can use any small coin, but a penny or a dime will work great. Put the coin on the top layer of the weed or push it down into the weed. Since the coin will move around the container as you shake it, you don't need to worry about its placement. Wash your coin or sanitize it with hand sanitizer, alcohol, or vinegar. This will keep germs from getting on your weed. Screw the lid back on the pill bottle. Put the lid back on the bottle and make sure it's tight. This will prevent the weed from falling out while you're shaking the container. Don't try to shake the weed without the lid. If the lid presses down over the bottle, simply push it down onto the container. Shake the pill bottle for 1-2 minutes. Set a timer or watch the clock so you can time yourself. Hold the pill bottle in your hand and shake it vigorously. As you shake it, the coin will cut and grind the buds into small pieces. Use the same motion that you'd use to shake a maraca. Check the weed to see if it’s your desired size. After 1-2 minutes of shaking the pill bottle, open the container and check to see if your weed is small enough to use. If it's not, put the lid back on and shake the bottle for another 1-2 minutes. Continue shaking it until you're happy with the size of the pieces. Depending on how thick your weed is, it can take a while to get your desired size. Expect to shake the container for at least 5 minutes. This method is safe and grinds effectively, so it's a great option for every day grinding. Place the weed into a coffee bean grinder. You can use any type of coffee grinder for your weed. Add the weed up to the fill line. Pack it loosely so that it's easier for the grinder to chop it up. Then, place the lid onto the grinder. A coffee grinder is great for when you need to grind up a bunch of weed at once. However, it's best to use dry weed because sticky weed may be harder to clean up. If you don't get all of the weed out of the grinder, it can get mixed into your coffee beans. Turn on the coffee grinder for 5 seconds. Plug up the coffee grinder if it uses electricity. Then, press the “on” or “grind” button to turn on the grinder. Count to 5, then turn off the grinder. You can also use an analog clock or watch to time the grinder. Keep grinding the weed until it’s your preferred size. Open the grinder and check the weed to see if the pieces are small enough. If they aren't, continue to grind your weed for up to 5 seconds at a time until you're happy with the size of the pieces. Check it frequently so that you don't accidentally grind it too finely. Clean your coffee grinder thoroughly after you grind the weed so that your coffee won't be spiked with THC. Place the marijuana buds on a clean chopping board. It's best to use a plastic chopping board because it'll be easier to clean. Start with a small amount of weed to reduce the risk of cutting yourself. Put the weed in the center of the chopping board so that it doesn't fall over the side as you chop. You can use this method with either dry or sticky weed, though it's best if the weed is dry. Use a clean, non-serrated knife to chop the buds into small pieces. If you have one, use a chef's grade knife for best results. Hold the knife blade over the weed on 1 end, then slice through it. Lift your blade and move it over about 1 mm, then slice into the weed again. Continue cutting the weed until you reach the other end. If you think the pieces are still too large, rotate the cutting board so that you can easily slice the weed in the other direction. Then, make a second pass to chop it into smaller pieces. You can technically use any knife to cut up the weed. However, a sharp, non-serrated knife works best, especially for sticky weed. Chop slowly so that you don’t cut yourself. Don't hold the weed in place with your hand because you could get cut. Instead, place your knife and your hand over the weed and slowly chop. This should help you cut the weed without it moving out of place. Cut up your weed like you would chop up garlic or herbs. Make sure your weed is dry before you use a mortar and pestle. Dried weed is easier to grind, especially if you're using a mortar and pestle. Check that your weed is dry and not sticky before you grind it. If it's not dry, try placing in the freezer for half an hour before you grind it. This method works best for small amounts. Additionally, it's a traditional way to grind up herbs. Place the weed inside the mortar. The mortar is the bowl that holds your herbs, and you'll rub the pestle into the herbs to grind them up. Fill the mortar about halfway so that there's room for the weed to shift around. Pack it loosely so that it's easier to grind. It's best to grind just enough for 1 joint at a time. If you're grinding more, grind your weed in smaller batches. Use the pestle to grind the weed into smaller pieces. The pestle is the tool that you use to grind herbs in a mortar. Push the pestle down into the weed and manually grind it. Continuously move the pestle around the bowl, grinding the weed. Stop grinding when you're happy with the size of your pieces. Use a firm pressure as you grind the weed.

train_12,How to Treat Your Mother on Her Birthday,"Give her your undivided attention. One of the best ways to communicate that you care is to spend some uninterrupted quality time with your mother. If you're celebrating your mom's birthday, don't spend half your time together checking your phone or chatting with a friend. Turn your phone and other distracting devices off in honor of her big day. When you're together, focus on having conversations and engaging with her. Even if you're in a group, your mom should be your top priority. Do a chore that she would normally do. You'd be surprised how much your mother would appreciate a break from a routine task, like cleaning the house or washing the car. Show you care by taking on the work for her. She'll appreciate it even more if you choose a chore that she finds especially onerous, like doing the laundry, cleaning the bathroom, or raking the yard. Help her with a project. Giving your mom your time and effort is a wonderful way to show you care while helping her accomplish something that she has been meaning to do. Pick a project that has been on her plate for a while, and lend her a hand to get it done once and for all. For instance, if she has been meaning to plant a garden, help her pick out some seeds, put on some gloves, and pick up a spade! If she would like to redecorate a room, help her shop for supplies, move furniture, paint walls, and hang up new art. Be sure to let your mom supervise the project, so it's completed according to her vision. You want to support her efforts, not take them over. Consult with her about how you can be the most helpful. Give your mom a day off. Sometimes, the best gift you can give your mother is some free-time to enjoy herself however she wants. To do that, make arrangements in advance to cover any obligations that she might have on her birthday. For instance, if she has other children, arrange a babysitter or babysit yourself. If she has a dog, volunteer to take care of it for the day or while she spends the night elsewhere. Oftentimes, just letting your mother sleep in is a much appreciated gesture. If that's the case, give her the gift of not bothering her in the morning, and bring her breakfast in bed when she wakes up. Share your favorite family stories. Your mother will feel appreciated if you can recall memories and anecdotes that you both cherish. Be sure to pick out a couple examples of times when she saved the day or did something wonderful to express your gratitude and show that you're paying attention. It's as easy as saying, ""Mom, remember that time when you surprised me with a party at the skate park for my birthday? That was awesome."" Bring up things like your family camping trip to Yellowstone, the time your mom came to your rescue when you were stuck at an airport six hours away, or the holiday traditions that you learned from your mom that make each celebration so special. You can even make this concept into an unforgettable gift idea by creating a memory jar. Pick a pretty container, and fill it with slips of paper that you've written your favorite memories of your times together on. Ask her about her favorite birthday memories. Listening to your mother's life stories shows that you're interested in her as a person. You'll also be grateful you took the time to learn something about what her life was like before you were around. You can spark a conversation about her past by saying, “Hey mom, what's the first birthday that you remember?” or “What's the coolest thing that you've ever done to celebrate your birthday?” You could even sit down together and look through an old photo album or two to jog her memory. If you see an image that intrigues you, ask her questions about it, such as: “Where was this taken?” or “Who is that sitting next to you?” or “How old were you then?” Make her a one-of-a-kind gift. Taking time to make your own gift is often better than anything you could buy. Tap your talents to make her something special. If you're a talented baker, bake her something special or assemble some baking mixes for her. If you're a whiz at knitting, make her a new set of mittens or hot pads. If you enjoy painting, create a piece of art to give her. Order a personalized gift. Many products can be personalized with messages, names, or monograms. Personalizing a gift for your mom will show that you've gone the extra mile to find a present that's uniquely hers. Pick a product that she'll appreciate (and that fits your budget). It could be anything from a mug to a bag, bath robe to a piece of jewelry. Make her a photo gift. Family photos mean a lot. Give her a lasting memento of one or more of your favorite moments by creating a photo gift. It could be anything from a simple framed photo to a printed pillowcase. Do a family photoshoot. This could be informal or at a studio. Either way, it says that her birthday is day worth remembering. Make her a family photo album. Assemble some of your favorites into a book that she can look at whenever she want a reminder of how much you care. Be creative by putting a favorite photo on an everyday item, like a vase, mug, ornament, apron, or pillow. Make her a recipe book. Create an archive of the recipes that you've enjoyed together over the years. Include all your family favorites in it, from staple main dishes to memorable treats to traditional holiday baking. Besides giving ingredients lists and directions, you can personalize the book more by adding photos and personal stories alongside the recipes. For instance, you can include photos of your family enjoying each dish and/or text that explains the origin of a particular recipe. Consider making copies for the whole family so that your mom will see that her culinary traditions will continue to be passed along. Add to one of her collections. Demonstrate that you're paying attention to what she loves by giving her a gift that fits perfectly into one of her personal collections. If she collects a particular kind of china, buy her a new piece. If she's wild about hogs, get her something with a pig design on it. If she has a favorite series, get her the next book or dvd in it. Take her on an outing. Make sure it's something she enjoys. If she's an antique buff, take her to a flea market. If she's an avid outdoors-person, take her on a hike and a picnic. If she loves cultural events, take her to a concert or a play. You might even consider recreating a favorite family outing, like a trip to a baseball game, cabin, or theme park. Treat her to a spa day. Being a mother can be demanding and stressful. Give your mom the gift of relaxation and self-care by treating her to a massage, facial, manicure, and/or pedicure. Make her dinner or take her out to eat. If your mom is usually the one to put food on the table, give her a night away from the kitchen. Cook one of her favorite meals, or take her to a restaurant that she's been meaning to try. Throw her a party. This option will require some planning and preparation, but it'll make your mom's birthday extra-special. Be sure to pick a time, place, and date that works for your mother. Keep in mind that you should give guests at least a couple week's notice so that they can get it on their calendars and make any necessary arrangements to get there. Since it's your mom's celebration, keep her in mind as you make the preparations. For instance, you should invite people that she'll want to see, serve food that she enjoys, and play music that she loves listening to. When in doubt, consult with her about her preferences. Remember not to leave the post-party dishes and clean-up for your mother!

train_13,How to Condition Your Hair With Aloe Vera,"Slice an aloe vera leaf. You can buy aloe vera plants online or at a local greenhouse. To extract the gel, slice the plant straight down the middle of the leaf. Move the knife slowly to avoid slipping up and accidentally cutting yourself. Make sure to use a sharp knife, as it can be difficult to make a clean cut with a dull blade. Remove the gel. Use a tablespoon to extract two tablespoons of aloe vera gel. Aim for the clear gel inside the leaf. There will be some yellowish gel near either end of the leaf. Do not gather this gel as you should only use clear aloe vera gel on your hair. Place the gel in a small container you can set in the shower, like a Tupperware container. Depending on the size of your plant, you may be able to get enough aloe vera gel from one leaf. However, if your plant is smaller, you may have to collect gel from another leaf until you have two tablespoons. Apply the gel in the shower. When you shower, you can apply the gel when you would normally apply your conditioner. Work it into your hair, moving from the roots to the tips. Use it exactly how you would use your normal conditioner. For example, if you normally let conditioner sit in for a few minutes in the shower, do so. Rinse out the gel. After apply the gel to your hair, rinse it out. Make sure to get all the gel out of your, especially the sticky bits. If you have a hair type that responds to aloe vera gel, your hair should be noticeably softer. Mix aloe vera gel and water. Add two tablespoons of aloe vera gel and two tablespoons of water to a bowl. Use a spoon to mix the gel and water together. Keep mixing until you have a liquid that's smooth and even throughout. You can buy aloe vera gel at any drug store. If you prefer, you can also extract it directly from an aloe vera plant. Add essential oils. You do not have to add essential oils if you do not want to or if you don't have them. However, essential oils can give the conditioner the added benefit of a pleasant scent. If you want, use an essential oil with a smell you like, such as lavender. Add a few drops to your aloe vera gel and water. Mix your ingredients in a spray bottle. Pour your water mixture into a spray bottle. Shake the bottle vigorously to mix all the ingredients together. Keep shaking until everything is mixed uniformly. Use the gel in place of your regular hairspray. After showering and washing your hair, use the gel in place of regular hairspray. Spritz it on when you would normally spritz on your hairspray in the morning. If your hair responds well to aloe vera gel, this should leave it slightly softer. Warm coconut oil in the microwave. Use as much coconut oil as you need. It depends on how much conditioner you want to make. Place the coconut oil in a small, microwave-safe bowl and microwave it. You should microwave the oil until it's melted into a liquid form. Cooking time depends on your microwave and the amount of oil. Cook the oil for short periods, like 10 seconds, and then check it. Continue to microwave the oil as necessary until it has melted. Mix in the aloe vera gel. Mix a tablespoon of aloe vera gel into the coconut oil. You can buy aloe vera gel at a drugstore or purchase it online. You can also extract it from an aloe vera plant. Whisk the ingredients together. Use a wire whisk or fork. Gently beat the ingredients together. Keep beating them until you have a uniform mixture. The oil may bubble slightly when being mixed, but this should not be a cause for concern. Apply the gel to your hair. After shampooing your hair, put a small amount of gel on your palm. Work it into your hair. Start at the roots and work the hair down to your tips. Keep working in the mixture until your hair is evenly coated in aloe vera gel. You may want to cover your hair with a towel in case the mixture drips. Leave the gel in for 10 minutes. Set a time and wait 10 minutes. After 10 minutes have passed, hop back in the shower. Rinse all the aloe vera gel out of your hair. If the gel works for your hair, it should leave your hair silky and soft.

train_14,How to Roast Pistachios,"Roast the pistachios in the oven to save time. If you are roasting over ⁄ 2 cup (120 ml) pistachios, use the oven. Choosing the oven will allow you to bake a big batch of pistachios at once. Place the oven rack in the middle of the oven. Have two racks in the oven on top of each other if you are planning to make two pans of pistachios so there is enough room. Preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C). It usually takes about 15-20 minutes for most ovens to preheat. Spread the pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet. Put them in an even layer on the baking sheet. Make sure none of the pistachios are covering each other, as this will ensure they roast properly. You can line the baking sheet with parchment paper to make it easier for you to lift the pistachios off the sheet when they are done roasting. You can use two baking sheets if needed, depending on how many pistachios you are roasting. Roast them for 6 to 8 minutes or until they become fragrant. Pop them in the preheated oven and watch them as they roast. Stir them with a spoon at the halfway mark so they roast evenly. They should take no longer than 8 minutes to roast fully. You will know they are done if they turn light brown and start to give off a nutty, fragrant smell. You can also check that they are roasted by cutting one or two pistachios in half. They should be an even pale brown color throughout. Let them cool. The roasted pistachios will take about 15-20 minutes to cool on the counter. Once they are no longer hot, store them in an airtight container. They should keep for 1 to 2 weeks. Use a skillet if you have a small amount of pistachios to roast. A skillet is ideal if you are roasting a handful of pistachios. The skillet will roast a small amount of pistachios quickly. Place a nonstick skillet on the stove on medium heat. Use a skillet that is wide and has raised sides so the pistachios do not fall out of the skillet. Make sure it has a nonstick coating so the nuts do not get stuck to the pan. You do not need to put any cooking spray or butter in the skillet. Roasting the nuts in a dry skillet is more effective. Put the pistachios in the skillet. Place them in an even layer on the skillet. Check that the pistachios lay flat on the skillet and are not on top of each other. Stir them constantly so they do not burn. As they start to roast, stand over the stove and use a spoon or a spatula to stir them around. You can also shake the skillet lightly by holding the handle and shifting the skillet around. This will ensure the nuts roast properly and do not get too hot. Remove the pistachios once they turn light brown. This can take 6 to 8 minutes, depending on your stove. The pistachios will give off a nutty, roasted smell when they are done. Allow them to cool. Take the pistachios off the skillet and put them on a plate to cool. Once they are no longer hot, store them in an airtight container for 1 to 2 weeks. Get plain pistachios. Buy pistachios that are raw and have no flavoring on them. You can find raw pistachios at your local grocery store or farmer's market. Buy pistachios in bulk to save money. Pistachios are an expensive nut and can be costly if they are bought in small amounts. Getting them in bulk may save you money in the long run, especially if you like eating a lot of pistachios. Remove the shells on the pistachios. Take the shells off by finding the opening on the shell. The shell should gape open at one end. Hold the pistachio between your thumbs and pull the shell apart until it snaps off. Removing the shell will make it easier to roast the entire nut. You can also crack the pistachio shell between your back teeth if the opening is not very big. Be careful not to bite down too hard on the shell, as you can damage your teeth. Leave the shells on for a more subtle flavor. If you'd prefer the pistachios have a less intense roasted flavor, you can leave the shells on. However, the pistachios may not be roasted evenly or all the way through if you keep the shells together. If you are using the skillet method to roast the pistachios, you should remove the shells so they can roast properly in the skillet. Prepare sweet and smoky roasted pistachios. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper so the nuts do not stick and roast the pistachios in the oven. Coat 1 cup (240 ml) unshelled raw pistachios with 20 teaspoons (99 ml) extra virgin olive oil, 20 teaspoons (99 ml) melted butter, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) honey, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) brown sugar, 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) sea salt, and ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) cinnamon. Let them roast for 10 minutes at 350 °F (177 °C). Stir them once and then roast them for another 5 minutes until they appear golden and caramelized. Remove them from the oven and stir them once. You can sprinkle extra sea salt on them for some added smokiness. Let the nuts cool and store them in an airtight container. They will last 1 to 2 weeks. Make curry flavored roasted pistachios. You will need to roast the pistachios in the oven on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) brown rice syrup, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) melted coconut oil, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) lime juice, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) mild curry powder, ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) sea salt, and ⁄ 8 teaspoon (0.62 ml) cayenne pepper. Pour the curry flavoring over 1.5 cups (350 ml) raw pistachios. Roast the pistachios at 300 °F (149 °C) for 25 minutes, stirring once at the halfway mark. Remove them from the oven and sprinkle them with cane sugar. Let them cool and then store them in an airtight container. Expect them to stay fresh for 1 to 2 weeks. Make spicy roasted pistachios. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper and roast the nuts in the oven. Combine 1 tablespoon (15 ml) olive oil, ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) salt, 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) cumin, ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) cayenne pepper, ⁄ 2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) black pepper, and 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) maple syrup. Pour the mixture over 2 cups (470 ml) raw pistachios. Let the pistachios roast at 300 °F (149 °C) for 30 minutes. Toss them at the halfway mark. Remove the pistachios from the oven and let them cool. Then, store them in an airtight container. Don't keep them for longer than 1 to 2 weeks. ","Response - This WikiHow article provides a comprehensive guide to roasting pistachios using two primary methods: oven roasting and skillet roasting, along with several flavor variations. The oven method involves preheating to 350°F, spreading pistachios evenly on a rimmed baking sheet, and roasting for 6-8 minutes while stirring midway to ensure even roasting. The skillet method is ideal for smaller quantities, using a nonstick pan on medium heat and constantly stirring to prevent burning. The article offers multiple flavor options, including sweet and smoky (with olive oil, butter, honey, brown sugar, and cinnamon), curry-flavored (using brown rice syrup, coconut oil, lime juice, and curry powder), and spicy (with olive oil, cumin, cayenne pepper, and maple syrup). Key tips include using raw, unshelled pistachios, potentially removing shells for more even roasting, and storing the roasted nuts in an airtight container for 1-2 weeks. The instructions provide precise measurements, cooking temperatures, and timing to help readers achieve perfectly roasted pistachios with various flavor profiles.","Response - This WikiHow article provides a comprehensive guide to roasting pistachios using two primary methods: oven roasting and skillet roasting, along with several flavor variations.

train_15,How to Throw Your Own Birthday Party,"Create your guest list first. By estimating your number of guests before you make any other plans, you'll be able to make decisions about the other elements of the party, including the venue, food, and drinks. Start planning your guest list as soon as you decide to throw yourself a birthday party. If you expect 5 guests, for instance, you'll have very different plans than a party with 50 guests. Choose a venue that's within your budget and the right size for your guests. Birthday parties are extremely flexible — you can meet up with a few friends in the park or you can host a formal event at a local restaurant. Think about the amount of money you have available to spend, how many guests you expect to attend, and the overall feel you're going for. If you want to have a casual, intimate celebration with a few close friends, host your party at your house. That way, you can set up at your own pace. If you'll be serving a meal to a large group, consider holding your party at your favorite restaurant. Just be sure to let guests know if you expect them to pick up their own checks. Rent a tent or a pavilion if you want to have a large outdoor barbecue for your party, but be sure you have a backup in case it rains. Decide whether you want a theme for your party. Picking a theme can help set the tone for the whole party, from the music to the decor and even what your guests wear. Of course, you don't have to have a theme, but if something seems fun to you, go for it! If you want to have a Roaring 20s theme, ask the girls to wear feathered headbands and flapper dresses, then decorate everything in black and gold and Art Deco. Serve champagne and play jazzy music when your guests arrive. Throw a 70s disco party by hanging a disco ball, decorating in neons, and playing fun dance music all night. Ask guests to wear platform shoes, bell-bottoms, and plenty of glitter, and have fun fruity cocktails available. Have your friends wear their jeans and cowboy boots to your Country-and-Western-themed party. Play line-dancing music and make sure there's plenty of beer on hand! Plan a menu you can prepare or pick up before the party starts. Unless you really love cooking all day, try to plan foods that can be prepared ahead of time, or order catering 1-2 weeks in advance if it's in your budget. You can also host a potluck-style party, in which you ask guests to bring a dish of theirs that you really love. If you're not going to serve a meal, opt for a variety of finger foods. Plan for 3 to 5 servings of appetizers per guest, although you might want to have extra on hand in case of last minute arrivals. If you are having a seated meal, small appetizers like chips and dip or pretzels will whet your guests' appetites without filling them up too much. In this case, 2 to 3 servings of appetizers per guest should be sufficient. Provide a variety of beverages, including water and soda, even if you're serving cocktails. Some of your guests may not drink, and they'll appreciate having plenty of options. Plan for guests to drink 1 beverage per hour, plus 1 additional drink apiece. If the weather is warm, you may want to have extra drinks on hand, since people will likely drink more. Order a birthday cake that's large enough to serve all of your guests. The size will depend on the shape of your birthday cake. If you decide on a single-tier 9 inches (23 cm) round cake, for instance, it will serve 24 people. Consult your baker to determine what size cake you will need based on your guest list. If you have multiple tiers, you can factor that into your serving size as well. If you don't want a birthday cake, you can have any dessert you like, including cookies, cupcakes, pies, or no dessert at all. After all,it's is your birthday party! Host your party earlier in the day if you don't want to serve a meal. If you're thinking of just having light appetizers, it's best to plan your birthday party for about 2 p.m. This will give everyone time to go home and have dinner afterwards if they're hungry. Ask your friends and family for help if you need it. It's your birthday, so you shouldn't be stressed out! Don't try to do everything on your own. If your mom makes a dip you love or your best friend is awesome at making crafty decorations, ask them if they'll help you. Chances are, they'll probably be happy to add their touch to your birthday! Invite more people than you expect to attend the party. Even with plenty of notice, some of your friends and family will have scheduling conflicts, may not feel well the day of your party, or may even forget.Conventional wisdom says that about two-thirds of your invited guests will attend your party. Of course, you should have extra supplies on hand in case everyone shows up! Choose guests who will make for a fun atmosphere. Invite people who will bring a positive energy to your party. Try to think of friends who are always positive, who tell the best stories, or who are always happy to meet new people. If you're having a large party, try to invite a mixture of people from different backgrounds, career fields, and even age groups. This will help ensure that your guests enjoy mingling with a variety of different people instead of just the same friends they see all the time. If you're having a small, intimate gathering, inviting friends who are already close is perfectly fine. Send out invites 3-6 weeks before the party. In an ideal situation, you'll be able give your guests plenty of notice so they'll have time to clear their schedules. If it's later than that when you start planning, just get the invitation sent as quickly as possible. Everyone loves getting something in the mail, so if you have enough time, mail paper invites! If you're on a time crunch, online invites are convenient and can reach your guests immediately. Include the date, time, and location of the party on your invitations. Read through your invitation a couple of times to make sure it covers all of the important information, including how guests can contact you to respond to the invitation. If your party has a theme or a dress code, include that on the invitation as well. Ask your guests to donate to a charity in lieu of gifts. Some people think it's tacky to ask for gifts for yourself. Sidestep this issue by stating on the invitation that you would prefer donations to your favorite charity instead of birthday gifts. Follow up with guests who haven't RSVP'd the week before the party. Remind them about the invitation and ask them if they think they'll be able to attend. This should help you get an estimate on the final head count. An added bonus to reaching out to your friends is that it will let them know that you genuinely care whether or not they're at the party. Try saying something like, “Hey Jane, I haven't heard from you! I'm really hoping you'll be at my party next Friday night, and Sasha and Joe said they're looking forward to seeing you again, too. Do you think you'll be able to make it?” Make sure there's enough seating for everyone. If you're going to be serving a meal, there should be at least 1 chair per person, and maybe a few extra just in case someone brings a last-minute guest. If the party is more casual, you should still have enough seating for about 85% of your guests to sit at any one time. Prepare a playlist that will set the mood for your party. You don't want to spend the whole party picking the next song that's going to play. If you don't have a stereo system, ask one of your friends to bring over a bluetooth speaker so you can play music loud enough for everyone to hear. Try playing laid-back tunes as your guests arrive, then transition into upbeat dance music as the night goes on. If you're having a big party, you might want to hire a DJ to keep the music going. Decorate for the party the day before, if possible. Setting up and decorating for a party almost always takes longer than you plan. If it's possible to set up the day before the party, you'll save yourself some stress on the day of the party. If it's not possible to decorate a day ahead, try to find a couple of friends who you can trust to take charge of the party decor. Ask them to arrive at the venue an hour or so before the party to hang decorations, set out party favors, and arrange chairs. Greet your guests as they arrive. If the party is at someone's house, answer the door yourself whenever you can. Greet your guests warmly, and try to introduce them to at least one person. If they already know everyone inside, announce their arrival. This will help your guests feel welcome and comfortable as soon as they arrive. If the party is held at a restaurant or another venue, try to get there early so you can greet guests as they arrive. Keep guests entertained with fun activities. You don't have to have every minute of the party planned out, but it's a good idea to have a few activities planned to give everyone something to do. If you're having a small get-together, plan a craft project that you and your friends can do together. If everyone at the party is an adult, play a drinking game like beer pong. Just make sure everyone who is drinking has a ride home! Put out games like cornhole or lawn darts for an outdoor party. Try to spend time with each of your guests personally. Don't spend too much time in any one place. Move from group to group, mingling with your guests. If you see anyone who seems bored, introduce them to someone you think they'll like. For instance, if 2 people in the room both ride horses, point that out and they'll instantly have something to talk about. If you have a certain friend who always makes other people feel comfortable, take the time to let them know it's really important they attend. You can even ask them to help you work the room, making sure no one is standing alone. Ask a couple of guests to stay to help you clean up after the party. It's your birthday, so you shouldn't be stuck with the clean-up all by yourself. When the party starts to wind down, ask some of your closest friends if they would mind helping you pick up behind the other guests. Have extra trash bags on hand so you can quickly dispose of paper plates, napkins, and plastic cups. It's a good idea to have extra resealable plastic bags and plastic containers with lids to easily store any leftovers.

train_16,How to Deal With Morton's Toe,"Look at your foot. If you have Morton's Toe, your second toe will likely be longer than your big toe. A normal foot shape is defined by a big toe that is longer than the rest, with toes 2-5 decreasing in length. You might have Morton's toe even if your second toe isn't longer than your big toe. You should always see a medical professional to diagnose this condition and to discuss treatment options. Understand the symptoms of Morton's Toe. Morton's Toe can cause debilitating pain and long term complications. Morton's toe causes surrounding bones to be displaced, putting unnecessary weight on the head of the second foot bone. This extra weight bearing causes stress to the bone, which causes a callus to form underneath the bone. A callus is a hard swelling of bone. This callus can cause moderate to severe pain in the foot. Some people with Morton's Toe have debilitating pain. This can be a strong, aching constant pain or a sharp pain during walking. Know the long term complications of Morton's Toe. This condition can lead to further problems down the road. Patients with Morton's Toe can have lower back pain, knee pain, and hip pain. This is due to slight changes in the way you walk when you have Morton's Toe. Arthritis is a common problem in people with this condition. This condition can also lead to bunions and hammer toes. Try over the counter pain relievers. These may initially reduce pain and provide temporary relief. These are not a long term solution to this problem. Over the counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen, naproxen, acetaminophen, and aspirin can help to reduce pain and inflammation. Other simple interventions can include keeping weight off of your foot and applying ice to reduce inflammation. These should not be used long-term. If you are experiencing severe, chronic pain you should see a doctor. Roll a frozen water bottle under your foot to relieve pain. Take a cold or frozen water bottle and place it on the floor. Then, rest the arch of your foot on the water bottle. Gently slide your foot back and forth so the bottle rolls from the ball of your foot down to your heel. Continue doing this for about 15-20 minutes. Consider buying new shoes. New shoes with the right shape and comfort level can help to relieve symptoms. Make sure your shoes have enough cushioning, and avoid tight shoes or high heels, which can make your symptoms worse. Purchase shoes with wider toe boxes. This extra room will provide some relief. Talk to a foot specialist about getting a custom orthotic with a neuroma pad. That will help separate the bones in your feet, helping you avoid the nerve pain caused by Morton's Toe. Use toe separators when you sleep. At night, put a toe separator like Yoga Toes, Correct Toes, or Perfect toes on your foot. This will help create some space between your toes, which will alleviate some of the pressure you experience throughout the day. See a podiatrist to get special orthotic inserts. This is often the only treatment needed for this conditions. This consists of putting a flexible pad under the metatarsal and toe in your shoe. This pad cushions the area. This changes the weight bearing on the toe and increases range of motion in the foot. Ask your doctor about cortisone injections. This may help you get rid of some inflammation. Sometimes one injection will help, but in some cases you might need 2 or 3 before they work. Sometimes, cortisone injections won't work at all. However, you'll have to see a foot specialist to get the injections done, so they may be able to help you come up with a more personalized treatment plan. Talk to a doctor about surgical options. Only do this if all other treatments haven't worked. Surgery is invasive and there are always risks so it is best to try all other options before resulting to surgery. Surgery can be done to remove a small section of the bone to decrease the length of the second toe and relieve extra weight bearing. Bone shortening is the most common type of surgery for this condition. Other bones in the foot can be lengthened with silicone inserts by a surgeon. Bone lengthening is not as common as other surgical methods. This type of surgery is more invasive and has more risk for complications. ","Response - Morton's Toe is a foot condition characterized by a second toe that is longer than or similar in length to the big toe, which can cause significant biomechanical and health complications. This condition affects foot structure and weight distribution, leading to potential pain and long-term health issues. Symptoms include foot pain, callus formation, and altered walking mechanics that can result in additional problems like lower back pain, knee pain, hip pain, and increased risk of arthritis. Treatment options range from conservative to surgical interventions. Initial management includes over-the-counter pain relievers, ice therapy, and lifestyle modifications such as wearing comfortable shoes with wider toe boxes. More specialized treatments involve using toe separators, custom orthotics with neuroma pads, and consulting a foot specialist. In cases of persistent symptoms, medical professionals might recommend cortisone injections to reduce inflammation.

train_17,How to Train Chickens,"Use treats to motivate your chickens. Chickens love food, so treats are good for reinforcing the behavior you're trying to teach them. When training your chickens, give them a treat after they do something right. Try to use treats that are different than their regular food. Some easy treats that chickens love are dried mealworms, bird seed, fruits, and vegetables. Come up with a sound your chickens will recognize during training. These sounds are called bridges. Any sound can be a bridge, as long as you can make it consistently so your chickens don't get confused. Use the bridge right after your chickens do something right and before you give them a treat. They'll start to associate the bridge with getting a reward. The bridge you use with your chickens could be the word “awesome” or you whistling. If you want to be certain your bridge will always sound the same, use a training clicker (like the kind they use to train dogs) as a bridge. Be consistent with your training. Chickens are smart, but you'll need to reinforce their good behaviors daily if you want your training to stick. Make an effort to work with your chickens at least once a day. The more often you train them, the faster they'll learn. Make your bridge noise and give your chickens a treat. Let your chickens see the treats in your hand so they approach you. Continue to do this around 2-3 times a day so your chickens associate food with the bridge noise. Make sure you're making your bridge noise first and giving them treats immediately after. Start hiding the treats while making your bridge noise after a few days of training. Watch your chickens reactions after you bridge. If they perk up and approach you like they're waiting for food, the training is working. Give them the treats after they've come to attention and approached you. If your chickens aren't associating your bridge noise with food, keep training them until they do. It could take several weeks for all of your chickens to get there. Let your chickens roam free once they associate your bridge noise with food. Make sure all of your chickens are adequately trained before you let them out. If one chicken doesn't associate your bridge with treats, that chicken won't respond when you try to call the flock back to their coop. Make the bridge noise when you’re ready for your chickens to come home. You may need to make it several times so all the chickens hear it. When the chickens return, give them their treats. If any of your chickens don't respond to your bridge noise, go collect them and bring them back to the coop. Keep training them until they make the connection. Put your palm face up on the ground and hold a treat in your free hand. Hold the treat close to your palm that's on the ground, so that your palm is in between the treat and the chicken. Show the chicken the treat and wait for it to walk over. Keep holding the treat close to your palm on the ground so the chicken has to walk onto your palm to get it. Don't give the chicken the treat just yet. Make your bridge noise and give the chicken the treat once it’s on your palm. Make sure both of its feet are on your palm before you bridge and give it the treat. Don't lift your palm off the ground yet. Let the chicken get comfortable stepping on your hand a few times first. Try again, this time lifting your palm a few inches off the ground. Wait for the chicken to step onto your palm before you lift it. Don't lift your hand too high at first or you may startle the chicken. Keep your hand steady in the air. Repeat daily, lifting your palm a few inches higher each session. Don't rush the process. Take it slow so the chicken gets used to standing on your hand. After a few sessions, try moving your palm back and forth slowly while the chicken is on it. Eventually, you should be able to walk around with the chicken perched on your hand. When you're ready for the chicken to get off your hand, gently place your hand on the ground so it can step off. Get an animal target trainer. Look for one online or at your local pet store. Target trainers look like a long stick with a ball at the end. If you don't want to buy one, make one for your chickens by attaching a wiffle ball to the end of a chopstick. With a target trainer, you can train your chickens to go anywhere you place the target, whether it's in their coop, your hand, or another spot in your yard. Place the target near your chickens. It doesn't matter where you place it at this point, as long as your chickens can access it. Wait for your chickens to notice the target and walk over to investigate. Reward your chickens when they get near the target. It's OK if they're a few steps away at this point. Make your bridge noise and give them a treat. If your chickens aren't going near the target at all, show them treats to lure them over. Wait for your chickens to get closer to the target before you reward them again. If they were 3 steps away from the target last time you gave them a treat, wait until they're 2 steps away this time. Make it incrementally harder for your chickens to get a reward. This will train them to get closer and closer to the target. Continue this until your chickens are walking right up to the target. Wait until your chickens peck the target to give them a treat. When they do, make your bridge noise and give them their snack. Every training session, continue to reward your chickens when they peck the target. Move the location of the target after a few training sessions. Don't move it too far at first; 3–4 feet (0.91–1.22 m) is enough. If your chickens continue to peck the target, you can start moving it to farther away to new places, like on top of a post or on a table. Your chickens should start to follow the target wherever you take it. Put your chicken’s target training to use. If you need to weigh your chickens on a scale, put the target on it and they will hop on. Quickly get your chickens into their pen by placing the target inside of it. You can even use the target to make your chickens run an agility course. ","Response - 
The WikiHow article provides a comprehensive guide to training chickens using positive reinforcement techniques centered around treats and bridge sounds. The training process involves several key steps: first, establishing a consistent bridge sound (like a whistle or clicker) that signals correct behavior, and pairing this sound with treats to create a strong association. Trainers should work with chickens daily, starting by making the bridge noise and immediately offering treats to help chickens recognize the connection. 

The training progresses to more complex skills, such as getting chickens to approach on command and even stand on a trainer's hand. A crucial technique involves using a target trainer (a stick with a ball on end) to guide chickens to specific locations. The process requires patience, incrementally rewarding chickens for getting closer to the target and eventually pecking it. Trainers should start with short distances and gradually increase the challenge, using treats and bridge sounds to reinforce desired behaviors.

The ultimate goals of this training include improving chicken responsiveness, creating easier management techniques (like guiding chickens into their coop), and potentially even teaching advanced skills like running agility courses. Consistency, daily practice, and positive reinforcement are key to successfully training chickens using these methods.","Response -

train_18,How to Apply Lotion to Your Own Back,"Squeeze a line of lotion onto the tops of both forearms and the backs of your hands. Hold your arm out flat in front of you with your elbow bent. The top of your forearm should form a level surface. Apply a line of lotion from the back of your hand up your arm almost to the crease of your elbow. Squeeze lotion onto both forearms. Do not rub the lotion into your arms, rather let it sit on your arm in the line you squeezed. You can use as much or as little lotion as you feel is necessary to cover your back completely. Place your arms behind your back. Bend your elbows and reach both of your arms behind you, placing the lotion covered forearms against your back. Depending on how flexible you are, this may hurt a little. It might be easier to place one arm behind your back at a time. If you have shoulder pain or are not very flexible, this method may not work well for you. Move your arms in a windshield wiper motion. Rub your forearms and the backs of your hands up and down your back like windshield wipers covering as much of your back as you can. You can use your left arm first to cover your left side and then place your right arm behind and use it to cover the right side of your back. Repeat this process as necessary if you don't feel like you got enough lotion on your back. Get a spatula. You can use a plastic or rubber spatula, and a wooden one will work too, but avoid a metal spatula. If you have multiple options, opt for whichever one has the longest handle. You may not want to use a spatula that you frequently use to cook. If possible, buy one that you can designate for the purpose of applying lotion. It's possible to get splinters from a wooden spatula, so be careful when using one. Squeeze a liberal amount of lotion onto the spatula. Keep the spatula as flat as you can when you squirt the lotion onto it so that you don't drop any onto the ground. You may do better to use a little less lotion and make more than one application. Gently reach the spatula behind your back. Do your best to keep the spatula flat with the lotion side up, bend your arm around to your back and place the lotion against your lower back. Spread the lotion around your back. Move the head of the spatula around in a circle covering your lower back first and moving up to your mid-back. You can then reach over your shoulder from the top and apply lotion to your upper back as well. Add more lotion if you need to and repeat the process until you have covered all areas of your back. Cut a two to three foot piece of plastic cling wrap. The exact length that you cut is up to you, but a longer piece will make the process easier. Use either a cutter that's attached to the plastic wrap box or use a sharp pair of scissors. Plastic cling wrap can be difficult to keep from tangling up and sticking to itself, so place it flat on the table before you cut it. This will help keep it from wrinkling up. If you don't have plastic wrap on hand, you could substitute a number of different plastic sheet options. If you have an old disposable tablecloth, you could cut from that. You could cut a strip from a trash bag. You could even use the wrapping from a big pack of toilet paper. Squeeze a blob of lotion into the middle of the strip. Squeeze as much lotion as you think you need onto the plastic strip. Lotion often goes farther than you think it will, so don't overdo it. A blob that is an inch or two wide should be sufficient. You can also put the lotion on the plastic wrap in a thin strip that is five or six inches long. Stand with plastic wrap behind you. If you try to pick up the plastic wrap while it is in front of you, you may up end with a mess. Turn so your back is toward the plastic wrap and you are close enough to touch it. If you laid the plastic wrap out on a counter that is too high for you to reach behind you, pick the plastic wrap up in front of you and move it to a lower surface. Reach behind your back and pick up the plastic wrap. Grab each end of the plastic wrap with one hand and lift it from the surface. Place the lotion against your back starting in the lower section first. You may need to turn your head and look over your shoulder so you can see where the plastic wrap is at in order to pick it up. Swipe the plastic wrap side to side on your back. Pretend that you are using a towel to dry off your back and pull the plastic wrap side to side distributing the lotion onto your back. You can use an upward zigzag motion to reach up toward the middle of your back. You can reach more areas of your back by letting go of the plastic wrap with one hand and reaching over the top of your shoulder to swipe the plastic wrap in a more up and down motion getting your shoulder blade area. If you are unable to move your shoulders or arma adequately, an alternative is to tape the plastic wrap to a flat vertical surface (doors work well and be cautious to choose a surface that will not be paint damaged and any over spill of lotion may be easily removed). Apply the lotion to an area of the plastic the same height as your target area. Turning away from the plastic, place your shoulder blades against it about three inches lower and the sliding your back on the lotion, stand up. Repeating this motion and moving from side to side should apply lotion to the entire target area. If necessary, apply lotion lower on the plastic and bend forward slightly to coat the small of the back. Buy a paint roller with roller cover. A standard 12 inch (30.5 cm) roller helps you cover the most area at once, but a smaller four inch one gives you a more precise application. Choose a ¼” nap thickness. You'll have a few options for the handle length, and your height will determine how long of a handle you need. You can buy paint supplies at home improvement stores, as well specialty paint stores or most big-box stores. If you already have a paint roller that is clean, you don't need to buy a new one. An addition option is to also buy a paint tray which is used to roll paint onto the roller. Squeeze lotion onto the roller. Squeeze some lotion in a line across the entire length of the roller. You may want to put two or three lines of lotion on the roller for better coverage. If you bought a paint pan, you can squeeze some of the lotion into the pan and roll the roller in the lotion to coat it. The amount of lotion that you use is up to you, and it may take a little bit of trial and error to determine the right amount. If you can squeeze some lotion around the entire circumference of the roller it may help you get a more even application. Roll the lotion onto your back. With the roller in your hand, bend you arm over the top of your shoulder and begin applying the lotion. Then switch and bend your arm around your side and behind your back and roll the lotion onto your lower back and mid-back. You may need to add lotion to the roller more than one time as some of it will soak into the roller.

train_19,How to Respond to Your Crush Asking You if You Like Her,"Pay attention to her tone of voice and body language. Consider why she is asking. If you have an idea about how she feels, it will help you have a more productive conversation with her. We communicate mainly through our tone of voice and body language, so try to understand what is going on using these signals. If she is raising her eyebrows, she might be uncomfortable. This might mean that she does not want you to like her. If she is mirroring your body language, then you are probably connecting. Perhaps she hopes that you like her back or she feels connected to you and wants you to know that she doesn't want the same thing. If she is making lots of eye contact, this shows interest. But it could go both ways, she could be interested in knowing how you feel because you are close and she doesn't want to hurt you, or because she likes you. A group of gestures together shows that she feels connected to you. For example, if she is smiling, she has her head titled to the side, and she is holding or touching her face at the same time, this could mean that she does like you. However, always believe what she says over any of the signals you get. Crossed legs and arms may mean that she is trying to stay closed off to you. This might mean that she is anxious or resistant to your feelings. Do not assume too much. Once you have considered how she feels and evaluated her body language, you do not have to over think her feelings for you. The truth is that you do not know for sure how she feels. And you will not know until you have asked her straight out how she feels. And believe what she says over the other signals you feel like you may be getting. Do not feel bad about what you think she feels or thinks. This is not going to help you stay confident, and it is also probably not accurate. Think about whether she is already seeing someone. This will help you to know how to talk to her. If she has a crush on someone else or is with someone else, you will want to approach this conversation differently. You would know because you may have heard other people talk about it, or she may talk about it herself. If you do know she is with someone else, acknowledge it at the start of the conversation. You will need to say that you do not want to step on her relationship. Stay a little more reserved or distant in your conversation, while still remaining honest. You can ask her, do you want me to tell you about my feelings? Sometimes when a person asks a question they are not interested in hearing a sincere answer. For example, in this instance she may be trying to point out that you are acting like you like her. Being honest and straightforward in your question “do you want me to be honest?” will be the best way to deal with this possibility. Stay further away from her physically and emotionally if she is with someone. Getting close to her or being very open and honest might make her feel uncomfortable. You will want to keep your distance. Think about whether she can date. Do you know whether she is allowed to date? Some people may be interested in dating but have parents who are strict about dating rules. If you know that she isn't allowed to date, you may want to acknowledge this fact in the conversation. Try to make her feel comfortable if she seems worried about her parents. Tell her that you do not want to step on her relationship with her parents. In this case you may not need to tell her that you have a crush on her. You can simply acknowledge that she is not allowed to date. Keep your distance physically to help her feel comfortable. Ask her if you two can talk somewhere. If you feel like she genuinely wants to know how you feel, you may want to have this conversation somewhere quiet. Think about going to a place where you can talk uninterrupted. You want to have this conversation in a space where you are comfortable to talk about how you feel openly. This can be a great opportunity to show her how cool you are regardless of why she is asking. If you can tell her how you feel and remain cool, calm, and collected, she will respect you all the more. Going on a walk can be a good option for a conversation like this. Walking can take away some of the awkwardness involved in the conversation. Walking is great because you are moving, not sitting and looking at each other. Going to a restaurant or coffee shop can also work if it is not busy. If you can find a secluded table to sit at or a table outside, this can be ideal. Go to a park. Sit on the swings or find a bench where the two of you can talk. Ask her where she would be comfortable having the conversation. In order to show her that you respect her space and boundaries, ask her to decide where you should go. If she does not have a preference, then you can suggest places to go. Look her in the eye and say “Yes, I do have a crush on you. ” Once you have had a minute and you are situated you can own how you feel, and be confident.  Be careful not to try to force her to feel the same way. Say that you like her in a way that is free of further implication. Free of implication means that you are not communicating a different message through your body language or tone. For example, do not look very intently at her in a way that asks her to like you back. Or do not lean forward into her space unless you know that she likes you. You could ask her how she feels before you say anything. However, it is more attractive and confident if you own how you feel and speak first. Ask her how she feels. She has asked you about your crush on her, and you can absolutely ask why she wants to know. Simply ask “why are you asking?” Do not assume that you know why she is asking. Once again, keep your tone and body language free of implication. Do not suggest that you know why she is asking with a flirty or accusing tone. Focus fully on what she is saying. Show interest, nod, smile and communicate that you understand through your body language and noises. Try not to interrupt her. Let her speak her piece. You can ask for clarification later. Give her feedback about what she said. You can say ""so what I hear you say is..."". This will let her know that you really listened and that you want to understand her. Do not be judgmental about what she is saying. This is how she feels and although it may involve you, do not take her feelings personally. Read on to the next method for more on not taking it personally. Respond with honesty and kindness. If she likes you back, you can tell her “I'm so excited that you like me too!” If she does not like you back, you can tell her honestly “I'm sad that you do not like me, but I appreciate that you told me.” You can also thank her for being brave enough to bring up the conversation. If she does not like you, do not make her feel bad for not liking you. Even if you honestly feel like she should like you, it is not your place to tell her that or make her feel that way. Talk about what you should do about your feelings. If she doesn't feel the same way, you might want to ask her if she still wants to be friends. If you do not feel like you two can be friends, ask if you can have space. If she does like you, ask her whether she would like to start dating. Try not to assume what will happen between you two if she says she has a crush on you, too. Instead, communicate with her how she feels about dating. If you want to start dating, ask her about what dating means to her and explain what dating means to you. You want to make sure that you are talking about the same thing. You may also want to discuss relationship expectations you have and ask her about her's. This may be a full conversation in itself, and one you come back to periodically. Follow up with her about the conversation later. Because it can be an awkward conversation, you may want to avoid talking about it. However, embrace the awkwardness and be confident. If you are still friends but she does not like you, you can simply tell her “thanks for having that conversation with me; I appreciated it.” You can also follow up over text message, but keep it brief. Do not try to change her mind, instead, acknowledge the conversation and then move on. Do not take it personally. Whether someone likes you or not says nothing about you as a person. You are still awesome for all of the same reasons. Do not let her romantic feelings change the way you feel about yourself. Think about it from her perspective. The more you understand her, the easier it will be to realize that it is not about you. Avoid jumping to conclusions. You don't know why she doesn't like you. Be careful not to assume that it is because of something particular about you. Make some space between you and your immediate reaction. Try to suppress any initial panicked emotions. Realize that your feelings will subside and wait for them to do so before you speak or do anything. Work on liking yourself. Liking yourself is more important than other people liking you. When you truly like yourself, it has an awesome effect- other people want to be around you more. Speak to yourself as a friend. You should offer yourself the same compassion, love and support you would to a friend who is going through a hard time. Imagine yourself confident and free. In your mind visualize what you would look like if you were perfectly confident and happy. What would you look like? Strive for being that person. Think about that person when you are in doubt about yourself. Feel good about being honest. It is hard to be open and honest with someone you like. If she does not also have a crush on you too, at least now you know. You are in a better position because you don't have to spend more time wondering about her. Being open and honest is a good habit to get into. With the next girl you like, you will be better able to interact with her because you had this experience. Take time to get over her. If you feel like you are not ready to start dating other people, work on yourself. Do not worry about liking someone again until you feeling better. Go out with your friends. Spend time with good friends who make you feel good about yourself. These people will remind you of your interests and the other things that you love. Distance yourself from her. If you are having a hard time with your emotions, tell her that you'd like some time and space from your relationship. Having her out of your life for the time being will help you focus on you. Start talking to new people. If you are feeling like you are ready to move on, pursue girls you are interested in. Hang out with groups of people that have new girls. Ask your friends about any get together coming up and attend them. When you meet a girl you like, ask her for her number. You can be direct and say “I really liked talking to you- can I have your number so we can keep talking?” Go on online dating websites. There are a few free websites that you can join and meet people to date. Lots of people use these applications to find people who share their interests and personality type. ","Response -
