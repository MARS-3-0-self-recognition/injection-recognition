train_5,How to Avoid Self Sabotage when You Feel Unloved,"Resist the temptation to self-medicate. When you feel emotional pain such as rejection from a loved one, you may be drawn to practices that allow you to numb your feelings. Feeling unloved can create both anxiety and depression, and you may try to treat these uncomfortable feelings on your own by using alcohol and drugs. Self-medication with substances may help you escape painful emotions in the short-term, but doing so can escalate into addiction, causing an even greater problem in the long-term. Some people may also self-medicate with other practices, such as binge-eating on comfort foods, shopping excessively, or having sex with various people to numb undesirable emotions. If you notice yourself engaging in unsafe or unhealthy behaviors, reach out to a friend or a professional counselor for support. Spend time with positive influences. There's a saying that you are the sum of the five people closest to you. If those near and dear to you engage in unhealthy, self-destructive behaviors like using alcohol or drugs, engaging in risky sex, or gambling, you are more prone to do the same. Carefully choosing your social group can make all the difference in the type of behaviors you do regularly. Make the choice to remove negative influences from your life. Highlight those relationships that influence you to make positive decisions like going to work or school, setting goals, and treating your body well. If you don't have any positive influences, open yourself up to making new friends. If you find that some people around you are negative influences, tell them, ""I'm sorry, but we're going to have to stop spending time together. I have been making unhealthy choices and I need to reevaluate many of my relationships."" Find creative outlets for pain. Rather than turning to self-sabotaging behaviors, use your emotional pain for good by getting creative. Exercising your inner creativity can help you channel negative feelings like rejection, disappointment, or hatred into positive activities like writing, painting, music, drama or any other art form. Being creative can help you heal from feeling unloved and decrease feelings of stress or anxiety. Use your emotional pain as a stimulus to draw a picture or write a song. Get out a fresh piece of paper and write a story. Or, you can turn on some soothing music and dance out what you are feeling inside. Challenge negative thought patterns. Sometimes the script running through your head all day can contribute to your mood. If you are thinking negative thoughts like “Nobody cares about me” or “I will be alone forever,” then your self-talk is steering you down a dark and depressed path. How you interpret situations and the world around you can make a big difference on how you feel. Learn to identify and challenge negative thoughts in order to stop self-sabotaging behaviors. If you notice yourself feeling particularly low or blue, try to think back to what you have been telling yourself in your head. Your thoughts are probably negative. For example, if you say “Nobody cares about me” because none of your friends or family called you, you can challenge the evidence surrounding this thought. Perform reality testing by asking yourself if your thoughts are facts or just your own interpretations. If you can think of one person who does seem to care for you, then you automatically cancel out the validity of the statement. Reframe negative thoughts to make them more positive and realistic. You might say, “Sometimes, I feel like nobody cares for me. Maybe if I called my loved ones instead of waiting on them to call, I wouldn't feel like this.” Ask for support when you need it. Often we might complain that no one seems to be there for us, but we don't actually make requests of loved ones. If you are guilty of wishing friends or family would reach out to you, but never taking the initiative, it's time to change that. Don't expect others to read your mind. If you want company, ask for it. If you need a hug, tell someone. You can simply say to a friend, “Jessica, I've been feeling very lonely and unloved lately. Can we make plans together this weekend to hang out? I could use some company?” Look for shared similarities. If you are always pointing out the differences between yourself and others, then you are making it hard to belong. When you stop paying attention to differences and focus on common ground, you will find more people with whom you can potentially connect. Find your tribe by challenging yourself to get out more. Join a book club based on your favorite genre. Participate in a local Meetup of singles in your age group. Take a Pilates class at your community gym. When you enter these social situations look for similarities between you and others. Then, point them out to start conversations. You might say, “Ooh, I love your gym bag! It matches my leggings! Where'd you get it?” Aim for greater empathy. Empathy is basically the ability to experience what another person is experiencing, or walking in their shoes. When you are able to adequately understand the feelings and perspectives of others, you will feel more connected to the larger whole of humanity. Instead of simply focusing on feeling unloved, strive to show more love and compassion to others through empathy. Start by improving your listening skills. Too frequently, we listen to reply rather than understand. When you are engaged in a conversation, orient towards the other person and make occasional eye contact. Eliminate distractions and fully focus on the other person's message. Try to imagine what they must be feeling based on their words. Mirror their emotional state by saying “Hmmm” or “Aww” as is appropriate. Then, summarize what you heard by saying “It sounds like you had a really rough time…” After attending to their emotions and clarifying that you received the intended message, you may share your own response. Volunteer. There is no better way to feel a part of the bigger picture than when you are lending a helping hand to those in need. In addition to allowing you to gain a sense of belonging, volunteering also gives you the chance to make a difference in your community. Community service also lifts your mood, helps you forge connections with others, and helps you spend your time in a meaningful way. Overcome your feelings of rejection and being unloved by spreading love to others. Sign up at a local civic center, church, nursing home, or school to help those in need. Identify your personal strengths. Cultivate a positive self-worth by figuring out your best qualities. Your personal strengths are the abilities, talents, and skills you have that make you an asset to the world around you. When you know what your strengths are you have a higher self-esteem and you feel more capable of managing life's problems. Make a list of personal strengths that you think may be used to describe you. These may include “loyal,” “intelligent,” or “compassionate.” If you have trouble coming up with ideas, ask a parent, teacher or close friend to give you some suggestions of strengths they see you demonstrate on a daily basis. You might also take a survey such as the VIA Character Strengths survey. Are you creative? Curious? Loving? Humble? A quiz or survey can inspire you. Create objective goals and work towards them. Goal attainment is another route to developing a stronger sense of self-worth. When you feel like you are moving towards something meaningful in your future, you are less likely to sabotage your progress with destructive habits. Plus, accomplishing goals creates a domino effect that will improve your mood and relationships, too. Set S.M.A.R.T. goals that are specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. For example, if you plan to learn a new language, you might say “I want to learn to speak intermediate Spanish within the next 6 months.” Then, you will devise a plan to reach that goal like listening to Spanish tapes, taking a course, and interacting with native Spanish-speakers. Promote your passions. Doing what you love can go a long way towards encouraging self-worthiness and a brighter mood overall. Think about activities you enjoy and build your days and weeks around doing them. Over time, you will notice that you are starting to live a more purposeful, happier life. Do you like building things? Start a new DIY project to build a piece of furniture for your home. Other hobbies may include writing, archery, gardening, bowling, or graphic design. A hobby can be virtually anything, and you can increase your love of the activity by joining a group of others who do it, too. This creates a sense of belonging and worthiness to help improve your outlook on life. Trying something new can also be helpful. Take up a brand new hobby or activity – this will get your creative juices flowing, challenge you, and teach you some new things. You may be surprised at what you learn. Nurture your body with a proper diet and exercise. You can enhance your self-worth through self-care. Of course, you already know that you should be consuming a balanced diet and getting regular physical activity. But, you may not know how these factors play into your perception of yourself and the world around you. When you nourish your body with healthy foods and stay active, you will feel more positive about your life and your relationships. When you feel bad about yourself, you may eat unhealthy foods and skip the gym. Show support for your body by eating plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low-fat dairy. Drink lots of water throughout the day. Go for a walk around your local park. Throw a ball to your dog. Or, ask a friend to join you on a cycling adventure. See a therapist. A professional mental health therapist can help you identify the source of your negative emotions and develop healthy skills to lead a more satisfying life. Your self-worth may have been jeopardized by unhealthy relationships or abuse from your past. Talking about these experiences in a unbiased and supportive context can lead to healing. One recognized form of therapy for those who self-sabotage is dialectical behavior therapy. This treatment approach is directed at gaining a better understanding of your feelings in order to build skills that help you stop problematic behaviors. You may work with your therapist to prevent overeating, stop risky sexual activities, and establish healthy relational patterns. Another is cognitive behavioral therapy. CBT will help you identify beliefs that fuel your self-worth. Once you identify those beliefs, you can explore their origins and validity and eventually replace them with thoughts and beliefs that are true. Determine if you require medication for depression. Self-sabotage is prominent in people who feel depressed but do not know how to express or improve their emotions. If feeling unloved has led to depressive symptoms, you need to see a doctor. Depression may manifest as a loss of interest in once pleasurable activities, withdrawing from loved ones, having trouble eating or sleeping, and feeling hopeless. A certain class of prescribed medications known as antidepressants are effective at improve depressive symptoms. This may be advisable if therapy alone does not improve your symptoms. Take part in a support group. Support is imperative for anyone struggling with mental illness. It's vital to build a network of health care providers and loved one who are there for you as you heal. However, meeting with other people who have gone through what you are going through can also be comforting. Ask your mental health provider about support groups for people who are struggling with the same issues as you. Attending these groups can help you learn how others cope with feeling unloved and help you gain a sense of belonging in a supportive group. ","If you're feeling unloved, you might engage in self-sabotaging behaviors, but you can break out of this cycle by developing your self-worth. When you feel rejected by a loved one, spend time with positive people who can lift you up. You can also find creative outlets, like drawing or singing, to help you feel better. Work on overcoming your feelings of rejection by spreading love to others.

train_6,How to Make Flavored Water,"Make citrus water. Wash 1–3 citrus fruits per quart (liter). Slice into thin rounds and leave in cold water for at least three hours. If you plan to leave it in longer for more intense flavor, cut off the rinds first to avoid bitter flavors. See below for a step-by-step guide covering all fruit and herb recipes. Try adding ¼ cup (60mL) mint or basil leaves. Flavor with strawberries or raspberries. Use about 1 cup (240mL) fruit per quart (liter) water. Fresh berries won't infuse well until they're crushed with a wooden spoon. Frozen berries are already broken, but you may crush further to speed things up. Infuse for three hours or more, then strain. This combines well with the juice of half a lemon. Create a cucumber concoction. Slice a cucumber into thin rounds and add to a pitcher of water. Let steep overnight, then drink within a day or two. Optionally, cut the whole cucumber in half lengthwise and scoop out the pulp before slicing. Enhance this mild flavor with three or four slices of lemon or cubes of pineapple. Mix blackberry and sage. This sophisticated combination is subtle but delicious. Try 1 cup (240mL) blackberries per quart (liter), plus a handful of sage leaves. Infuse with apple. Apple and other hard fruits don't seep flavor as quickly as others. Slice very thinly and infuse for up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. An hour before serving, transfer to room temperature for added flavor. Select your fruit. Follow one of the recipes above, or just choose your favorite fruit. You can play around with the amounts, but start with several small fruits per quart (liter), or 1–2 cups (240–480mL) berries or cubed fruit. Fresh fruit in season has the best flavor. Frozen fruit won't look as attractive, but may have more flavor than out-of-season fresh fruit. Wash fruit thoroughly. Rub all fresh fruit thoroughly under cool, running water. Since the peel will be sitting in the water, scrubbing contaminants off the surface is extra important. If the fruit is not organic, consider peeling it to remove pesticides on the surface. This is not necessary for frozen fruit. Slice into wedges or rounds. Rounds will infuse more quickly on their own if they are weighed down underneath ice cubes. Wedges may not add much flavor unless you muddle the fruit as described below. Slice rounds in half for a narrow pitcher. No slicing is necessary for berries or cubed fruit. Add to cold water. Drop your fruit into a pitcher of chilled or room temperature water. If you dislike the taste of your tap water, put it through a filtration device before adding fruit. Hot water will infuse with flavor more quickly, but turns the fruit into mush and may destroy some nutrients. Muddle gently (optional). Crushing the fruit will speed up the infusion significantly, but you may end up with a murky, pulpy mixture. For a more attractive pitcher, squeeze some of the juice out using a wooden spoon handle, pressing and twisting but not pulverizing the fruit completely. Leave the fruit untouched if you can wait a few hours. Alternatively, leave whole slices in for decoration, but squeeze in the juice of one fruit to add more flavor. To flavor a single glass of water for immediate drinking, pulverize the fruit with a muddling stick. Add a handful of herbs (optional). Mint and basil are the most common options, but you can use rosemary, sage, or just about any other herb. Rinse the leaves, then rub them between clean hands to bruise them slightly before adding to the water. You can add dried herbs, but place them in a tea strainer so they don't leave fragments in the drink. Add ice (optional). Besides chilling the water, ice weighs down fruit that floats to the top and filters out some of the fruit pieces while pouring. Wait for infusion. Chill the water in the refrigerator for 3–4 hours, or up to 12 hours for extra-potent flavor. To avoid bacteria and unpleasant flavors, strain out ingredients after 12 hours and drink within three days. Stir before serving. The water will infuse faster at room temperature, but also decompose faster. Steep for 1–2 hours, and drink within 4–5 hours of mixing. Combine with tea. Let your fruit sit in the same pitcher as a tea bag or tea strainer. Keep this at room temperature, so the tea infuses without overpowering the other flavors. Steep for 1–3 hours, remove tea, and drink immediately. Try these recipes, adding each one to a quart (liter) of water: Black tea bag, three mandarin oranges, four basil leaves, black tea bag Two green tea bags, ½ mango (sliced), ¼ cup (60mL) strawberries Infuse with spices. Add a stick of cinnamon, a tablespoon (15mL) fresh grated ginger, and/or ¼ tsp (1 mL) vanilla extract. These work particularly well in tangy recipes. Try the following: ½ cup (120mL) cubed pineapple, ½ sliced orange, 1 tbsp (15mL) grated ginger 1 cup (240mL) blueberries, ¼ tsp (1 mL) vanilla extract Replace regular water with seltzer. Make your own soda replacement with low sugar and no artificial sweeteners. Mix in coconut water. Replace ¼ of your water with coconut water. Try infusing with peaches or honeydew melon. You may use coconut milk instead, but the thicker, richer drink may be more difficult to balance with fruit. ","To make flavored water, slice citrus fruits into rounds and leave them in cold water for at least 3 hours. If you want to flavor your water with berries, crush them up, add them to cold water, and allow them to infuse for 3 hours.

train_7,How to Play Powerball,"Know where (and to whom) Powerball tickets are sold. In 43 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, Powerball tickets are available at authorized lottery retailers, which means they are usually found at the same places that most other lottery tickets are - drugstores, gas stations, and grocery stores. The game can be played by anyone over the age of 18. You don't have to be a resident of a Powerball state to play if you purchase your ticket in a Powerball state. You don't even have to be a U.S. citizen to play and win the Powerball. However, if you are not a U.S. citizen and you win a substantial jackpot, the IRS deducts a flat rate of 30% from your winnings. U.S. citizens are subject to different rules. Powerball tickets are not sold in Alaska, Hawaii, Nevada, Utah, Alabama, and Mississippi. These states prohibit lotteries by law. Finally, Powerball tickets cannot be purchased via mail or the internet, except from the website of Powerball's recommended lottery ticket service, which purchases legal tickets on your behalf. Know when drawings occur. Official Powerball drawings occur every Wednesday and Saturday night at 10:59 PM Eastern Time. Powerball ticket sales cut off at least 59 minutes before each drawing, though they may occur earlier. When you buy a Powerball ticket at the store, unless you pay for multiple drawings, it is only valid for the next drawing. In other words, if your Powerball ticket doesn't win, it's not eligible to win in future drawings, unless you specifically pay for multiple drawings. The more drawings that occur without a jackpot winner, the higher the jackpot gets. Jackpots start at a minimum of $40 million and increase each time a drawing occurs without a jackpot winner. Current drawing results are posted to the top of the USA Mega Millions and Powerball website. Most places where Powerball tickets are sold will also post the most recent draws. Understand how Powerball is played. Powerball is played by selecting six numbers - five numbers between 1-69 and one number between 1-26. Each number is on a special ball that is randomly selected by a machine during the drawing. Your ultimate goal is to match every number selected perfectly, which will win you the jackpot. However, there are other winning combinations of numbers that will win smaller prizes (which can be quite lucrative in their own right). Your first five numbers don't have to be in the same order as the balls that are drawn. Winning numbers win regardless of the order they're listed in. However, the final Powerball number must match exactly - none of the first five numbers can count toward it. The number of balls and the odds change regularly. They are current as of January 2016. Know Powerball's prize-winning combinations. If the numbers you picked match the numbers drawn in any one of nine combinations, you can collect your winnings. Note that the prize amounts below represent base values - Power Play prizes are subject to a 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x multiplier, selected at random (except for Jackpots, which aren't multiplied, and prizes for matching five white balls, which will only double). The winning combinations are: Matching only the red ball: $4 winnings Matching the red ball and one white ball: $4 Matching the red ball and two white balls: $7 Matching three white balls: $7 Matching the red ball and three white balls: $100 Matching four white balls: $100 Matching the red ball and four white balls: $10,000 Matching five white balls: $1,000,000 Matching the red ball and five white balls: Jackpot! Note: prizes differ in California because state law requires lottery prizes to be awarded on a pari-mutuel basis. Get a ticket. Single Powerball tickets cost $2 a piece. In every state except California, you also have the option to play “Power Play”. Power Play is an add-on to the ticket price that increases your winnings for all non-jackpot prizes should you win. As of January 2014, prizes for winning tickets with the Power Play add-on are subject to a 2x, 3x, 4x, or 5x multiplier, selected at random before each drawing. For instance, a $4 prize would become either $8, $12, $16, or $20 with Power Play. This option costs $1 extra. The Power Play option is unavailable in California because state laws require that lottery prizes be paid on a pari-mutuel basis. This means that lottery prizes can't be set at absolute values, but must fluctuate based on the number of tickets sold and the amount of winning tickets. Fill out your ticket. Though Powerball tickets will vary slightly from state to state, the basic method for filling a ticket out is the same everywhere. On your ticket, you'll need to specify the numbers you want to bet on, the number of drawings you want, and whether or not you want the Power Play option. Follow the guidelines below for filling out a basic ticket: Fill in the spaces for five numbers from 1-69 and one number from 1-26. Usually, Powerball tickets are divided into multiple sections called ""boards"" which have rows of multiple-choice style bubbles to fill in to choose your numbers. Each board essentially counts as one $2 ticket. In other words, for $2, you can fill out one board on the ticket and bet on a single set of numbers. Each subsequent board filled out costs $2 more but allows you to bet on an additional set of numbers. Indicate for each board whether you'd like the ""Power Play"" option. Each board (except in California) should have a space that allows you to buy a Power Play for your set of numbers. For random numbers, fill in the QP space instead of your numbers. ""QP"" stands for ""Quick Pick"" - this lets a computer randomly choose numbers for you. Choose how many drawings you want. Most tickets have a ""Multidraw"" section that allows you to pay for multiple drawings. For instance, if you want to bet on your numbers for two back-to-back drawings, fill in the ""2"" space. Each subsequent drawing costs as much as an additional ticket. If you make an error on any board, fill in the ""VOID"" space for that board. Don't try to erase - instead, mark the board void and fill your numbers in on another board. When you're finished, pay for your ticket. The clerk will calculate the price of your ticket based on how many boards and Power Plays you've selected. For example, if we play 5 draws on one board with a Power Play and 5 without, we would pay 5 × 3 + 5 × 2 = $25. Alternatively, ask the clerk for a Quick Pick ticket. If you don't wish to fill out a lengthy Powerball ticket by hand or you don't care which numbers you bet on, you can usually ask for a Quick Pick ticket instead of the normal Powerball ticket. In this case, a computer will randomly choose your numbers for you as if you had filled in the ""QP"" space for a board on the normal ticket. If you win, collect your winnings. Small prizes can be claimed directly from the vendor you bought the ticket from, while larger prizes require official verification. If your winnings are less than $600, simply go to the lottery retailer with your ticket to claim your winnings. If your winnings are over $600, go to a lottery district office to present your ticket. The precise procedures for claiming large prizes differ from state to state - you may need to fill out a claim form, etc. Powerball tickets do expire. The time window you have to claim a prize differs from state to state - from 90 days to a full year. If you can't make it to the vendor or lottery office for some reason (for instance, if you've left the state you bought the ticket in), it's legal to mail your ticket to the state lottery office. Powerball provides a map that links you to state lottery pages, which will have more specific information about claiming prizes in your state. For jackpot prizes, choose a payout option. Congratulations, you won the jackpot! The only question remaining before you retire is this: how would you like your money? Powerball jackpot winners have two options for receiving their cash - they can receive the entire prize at once in a lump sum , or they can receive it as an annuity - in other words, in yearly installments. Choosing which prize to take is a complicated decision that will differ based on your personal financial situation. Taking the cash as a lump sum will give you lots of money up front, so it may be a good idea if you have a dream purchase or investment you'd like to make immediately. The annuity option invests the cash winnings, gives you your first installment immediately, then gives subsequent payments each year for 30 years (plus interest), which is a better situation for long-term stability. Note that Powerball winnings are subject to federal and/or state income taxes. Because of this, the annuity option will net you more money in the long term - not only will you receive interest on your winnings, but each year you'll only have to pay taxes on about 1/30th of your total prize, meaning more of your prize will be taxed at a lower bracket. On the other hand, with a large lump sum payment, you can expect to pay up to about half of your winnings in taxes, depending on your state's income tax rules. Understand Powerball odds. Like any lottery, Powerball's jackpot odds are very slim. Many avid Powerball players consider the excitement of going against the odds to be part of the fun.

train_8,How to Apply Heat Transfer Vinyl,"Choose and purchase vinyl. There are many colors and patterns to choose from. Look online for vinyl, or visit your local craft store to get a better idea of what the vinyl will truly look like. Consider bringing fabric samples with you, to make sure your vinyl color will be visible. Make sure you purchase a vinyl compatible with the fabric you want to use. Some vinyls are only for cotton, others work best on spandex. Design your own image using computer software. You can use a program like Photoshop or its free alternatives such as Gimp, Seashore, and Pixlr. Choose bold, easy to read fonts when adding letters to your design. Consider how much room you will have on the fabric you are transferring onto. For example, if your design is for a baseball hat, you might want to keep it simple, and not add too much information in it. Choose pre-printed vinyl designs if you don’t have design software. You can purchase vinyl designs online and in stores. Reverse your design. It is very important to remember is to reverse the image, so that it does not come out backwards on your final product. Most software will have an option to “mirror” the image, if not, use edit tools like “flip horizontal” or “flip vertical” to make sure you print your design as a mirror image of what you want. If you're using words, make sure the letters are backwards, for example, “love” should read as “evol” in your design Similarly, make sure individual letters are backwards. Run you're design through according to the instructions of your cutter. If you are using a specialty cutter, remember that with most machines, you will need to feed the vinyl dull-side-up. Print your image directly on the vinyl if you do not have a cutter. You may need to cut the vinyl sheet down to the size of printer paper. Make sure your image prints on the back, the dull side, of your vinyl. Alternatively, print your image on paper and then use artists tape to tape down the paper to the vinyl, and the vinyl to your work surface. Cut out your design by hand if you are not using a cutter. Place your vinyl on a workspace shiny side down. Using an exacto knife, or precision scissors, carefully follow the stencil you have printed out. Take breaks to make sure you are cutting all the way through the first layer, but not cutting through the entire vinyl. You can also use a paper puncher or a die-cut machine to make fast shapes. Peel your vinyl. Carefully peel away the clear layer of the vinyl, making sure not to rip any part of your image. Peel away everything that is not part of your final design. ""Weed"" your design with sharp tools like a pointed needle and exacto knife. Weeding is when you remove small parts of your image's negative space. Use the sharp points of your tools to pick up small areas and peel them off more easily. Heat a clothes iron to the temperature written on your vinyl's packaging. It is also good to prepare your fabric by running your iron over it to get out all wrinkles and moisture. Lay your design onto the fabric, this time shiny side up. It should be positioned how you want it to look in your final product. Press your iron onto your design, hard, for about 15 seconds. Move along to the next section of your design, and press for another 15 seconds, making sure each part of the vinyl gets ironed on!  Do not hastily rub the iron over the vinyl as if you were ironing an item of clothing quickly, you do not want to accidentally wrinkle the vinyl. Peel off the carrier sheet. Read the instructions that came with your vinyl, some require that you peel off the carrier sheet once your project has cooled, others should be peeled off right away. Wash your new item inside out using cold water. Do not wash your item for 24 hours after applying the heat transfer vinyl. Follow the care label of the item, but do not bring it to the dry cleaner, the chemicals used are too harsh. Dry your item with low or no heat, and iron your vinyl item carefully. Again, turn the fabric inside-out, and tumble dry on low heat. Alternatively, you can lay your item flat to dry, or line dry it. Use teflon sheet paper over the vinyl when ironing, or turn the item inside-out, and use low heat on the iron. Fix areas that are peeling off with an iron and teflon paper. If your vinyl is peeling off, iron the peeling parts back on with the same heat setting you used for that vinyl before, placing teflon paper over the vinyl beforehand. Press for 15-20 seconds. ","To apply heat transfer vinyl, start by heating a clothes iron to the temperature indicated on the vinyl's packaging. Next, lay your design onto the fabric, shiny side up.

train_9,How to Screen Print at Home,"Purchase a canvas stretcher frame at a craft or art supplies store. These are basic, inexpensive frames made of wood for mounting a canvas. For a little more money you can purchase an aluminum frame that will last longer, as repeated washing will warp a wooden canvas. Many art stores now sell pre-made silkscreens as well, so you could purchase a standard screen if you don't want to make a custom one. Ensure that your frame is big enough for your design. If you don't know your design yet, or want a versatile frame for multiple designs, aim for 12x18"" at the minimum. Purchase your mesh. You want a nice, fine mesh that allows the ink to pass onto the shirt, paper, or design. Mesh-count measures how loose or tight the mesh is, where higher numbers indicate a tighter mesh. The tighter the mesh, the more intricate your details can be. Mesh count is the number of threads in one square inch. For the classic ""athletic"" or collegiate print that looks worn/speckled, aim for a loose 85 mesh count. For a ""do-it-all"" mesh, aim for 110-130 mesh count. For paper or plastic printing, go for a mesh count near 200-250. In general, lighter colored objects work best with higher mesh counts. So if you're doing white paper, aim from 230-250. Staple the mesh into the frame. Make sure you pull the screen tight before you start stapling. You want it to be as taut as possible without ripping. Stretch the mesh across the frame and staple around the wood every 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 cm.). You will likely need an electric staple gun to securely adhere the mesh. You can also use framing nails. Create a stencil of your design. Silkscreens can only apply one color at a time, so create a simple shape or outline to begin learning. Whatever you draw will eventually be the inked part of the print. To make your own print, you need: Poster board, thin cardboard, or other thick & sturdy paper. Pencil X-acto knife or another precision knife Know the artistic limitations and challenges of screen-printed designs. Screen printing isn't difficult, as what you draw is exactly what you get on the final print. However, there are certain principles and limitations to screen printing that you should know as you design your print: You can only print 1 color at a time. High contrast images (like black on white) work the best, as you cannot use shading. For complex designs, you need to make multiple prints, one for each color, and layer them after the ink has dried. Sketch your design onto the poster board. Sketch out the blocks of your design. You can upload photos or other images into photo editing software as well and use those. To do so, reduce the drawing to a basic two-tone outline then print it. To make a stencil on Photoshop, for example, you would take a black and white image and click Image → Adjustments → Threshold, then set it up near the highest it can be. Cut the design out as a stencil. Everything that you cut away will be un-inked on the final print, and everything covered by the stencil will be covered in ink. For example, imagine you are printing the red logo of a bulls-eye on a white t-shirt. When you cut out the stencil, all of the rings that you cut away will be white, and all of the rings that are covered by the stencil will be red. Alternatively, draw your design on transparent paper. For complex prints, it can be very difficult to cut out the entire outline. In this case, use thick black ink on transparent paper to make your stencil. Your stencil or drawing needs to block light, as this is what etches the design into the screen and allows you to print. Everything covered by a stencil or black ink will not get exposed to light, leaving it ""open"" and allowing ink to pass onto the shirt or item. Coat your silk screen with a thin layer of photo emulsion. Pour a line of emulsion along a side of the screen and use the squeegee to spread a thin line along the entire screen. Photo emulsion reacts to light, hardening when exposed, so anything not covered by your stencil will turn into a barrier preventing ink from getting through. Apply emulsion to the flat side of the frame, not the side surrounded by wood. Do this in as dark a room as possible to prevent the emulsion from hardening before you're ready. Let the emulsion dry in a dark space. Expose it to as little light as you can. A closet or bathroom will work well, as long as you can close some curtains Set up an ""exposure area"" while waiting for the emulsion to dry. You'll need to expose the emulsion to a direct, strong light to prepare it. Following the specification on the photo emulsion bottle, set up a light above your flat black surface. Each emulsion has different times, watts, and distances needed for proper hardening, so be sure to read the bottle before beginning. The lamp should always be 1-2 feet above the emulsion. If the emulsion calls for 30 minutes at 200 watts, set up a lamp with a 200W bulb 1-2 feet above a table. The screen goes under the light. Place your screen under the light in the exposure area. As you're moving the screen, cover it with a towel so it does not react to incidental light. Place it under the lamp in your station, leaving the towel on for now. Put your stencil backwards on the middle of the screen. The screen should be emulsion side up. The mesh will be lifted a few inches off the table and resting on the frame. Place your stencil in the middle of the screen with 4-5 inches of space between the design and the edge of the frame. You must place your stencil down in reverse to get the right image. Look at your stencil the way you want it, then flip it over before you put it down. Otherwise, you will get a mirror image when you start printing. If there is a breeze, or your stencil is very light, place a clear piece of glass on top of it to keep it from moving. Do not push, prod, or move your screen, light, or stencil once it is placed and set. Turn on the light for the recommended time. Simply follow the instructions on your emulsion bottle and remove the screen when it is done. When it is done, remove the stencil and set it aside for later. If you smell anything burning during this process, turn off the light immediately. If you prepared the emulsion correctly, you should see the faint outline of your stencil in the emulsion when the design is removed. Blast off the emulsion with cold water. Take any high-powered water source (shower, faucet, hose) and wash off the screen, focusing on your image. The water will wash away the unhardened emulsion around your design. You should see the outline of your stencil appear. Keep on spraying until you can see your image well.  Let the screen dry before moving on to the next step. Line up your screen above the object you're printing on. The mesh should be touching whatever you're printing on, like paper or a shirt. If you're using a shirt, slide some cardboard between the layers of the shirt to prevent the ink from bleeding through. Squeegee some ink over your design. Put a thin line of ink just above your design. Then drag the squeegee over your design firmly, coating the entire stencil in ink. The harder you press the darker your image will be. Slowly pull off your silkscreen. Pull the screen off the t-shirt/paper with even pressure, then hang the shirt up to dry. Your design will be printed. Repeat with as many shirts as you want, cleaning the screen occasionally. You can use your silkscreen again with another t-shirt if you want, adding more ink as necessary. Simply wipe down the backside after every shirt and reapply ink. If you're using the same print for multiple days in a row, rinse and dry it at the end of each day.
